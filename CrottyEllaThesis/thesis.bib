When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure.

  abstract = {Coastal and estuarine waters of the northern California Current system and southern Salish Sea host an observational network capable of characterizing biogeochemical dynamics related to ocean acidification, hypoxia, and marine heatwaves. Here, we compiled data sets from a set of cruises conducted in estuarine waters of Puget Sound (southern Salish Sea) and its boundary waters (Strait of Juan de Fuca and Washington coast). This data product provides data from a decade of cruises with consistent formatting, extended data quality control, and multiple units for parameters such as oxygen with different end use needs and conventions. All cruises obtained high-quality temperature, salinity, inorganic carbon, nutrient, and oxygen observations to provide insight into the dynamic distribution of physical and biogeochemical conditions in this large urban estuary complex on the west coast of North America. At all sampling stations, conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) casts included sensors for measuring temperature, conductivity, pressure, and oxygen concentrations. Laboratory analyses of discrete water samples collected at all stations throughout the water column in Niskin bottles provided measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved oxygen, nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, and silicate), and total alkalinity (TA) content. This data product includes observations from 35 research cruises, including 715 oceanographic profiles, with \&gt;7490 sensor measurements of temperature, salinity, and oxygen; ≥6070 measurements of discrete oxygen and nutrient samples; and ≥4462 measurements of inorganic carbon variables (i.e., DIC and TA). The observations comprising this cruise compilation collectively characterize the spatial and temporal variability in a region with large dynamic ranges of the physical (temperature = 6.0–21.8 ∘C, salinity = 15.6–34.0) and biogeochemical (oxygen = 12–481 µmol kg−1, dissolved inorganic carbon = 1074–2362 µmol kg−1, total alkalinity = 1274–2296 µmol kg−1) parameters central to understanding ocean acidification and hypoxia in this productive estuary system with numerous interacting human impacts on its ecosystems. All observations conform to the climate-quality observing guidelines of the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program, and ocean carbon community best practices. This ongoing cruise time series supports the estuarine and coastal monitoring and research objectives of the Washington Ocean Acidification Center and US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Ocean and Atmospheric Research programs, and it provides diverse end users with the information needed to frame biological impacts research, validate numerical models, inform state and tribal water quality and fisheries management, and support decision-makers.

During summer 2021, an unprecedented number of ship- and underwater glider-based measurements of dissolved oxygen were made in this region. Near-bottom hypoxia, that is dissolved oxygen less than 61~µmol~kg−1 and harmful to marine animals, was observed over nearly half of the continental shelf inshore of the 200-m isobath, covering 15,500 square kilometers. A mid-shelf ribbon with near-bottom, dissolved oxygen less than 50~µmol~kg−1 extended for 450~km off north-central Oregon and Washington. Spatial patterns in near-bottom oxygen are related to the continental shelf width and other features of the region. Maps of near-bottom oxygen since 1950 show a consistent trend toward lower oxygen levels over time. The fraction of near-bottom water inshore of the 200-m isobath that is hypoxic on average during the summer upwelling season increases over time from nearly absent (2\%) in 1950–1980, to 24\% in 2009–2018, compared with 56\% during the anomalously strong upwelling conditions in 2021. Widespread and increasing near-bottom hypoxia is consistent with increased upwelling-favorable wind forcing under climate change.},

The resistance to transfer through both air and water phases is highly sensitive to physical drivers (waves, bubbles, films, etc.), which can either enhance or suppress the rate of diffusion. In addition to outlining the fundamental processes controlling the air–sea gas exchange, the authors discuss these drivers, describe the existing parameterizations used to predict transfer velocities, and summarize the novel techniques for measuring in situ exchange rates. They review trace gases that influence climate via radiative forcing (greenhouse gases), those that can alter the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere (nitrogen- and sulfur-containing gases), and those that impact ozone levels (organohalogens), both in the troposphere and stratosphere. They review the known biological and chemical routes of production and destruction within the water column for these gases, whether the ocean acts as a source or sink, and whether temporal and spatial variations in saturation anomalies are observed. A current estimate of the marine contribution to the total atmospheric flux of these gases, which often highlights the significance of the oceans in biogeochemical cycling of trace gases, is provided, and how air–sea gas fluxes may change in the future is briefly assessed.},

  abstract = {The Copepoda is a clade of pancrustaceans containing 14,485 species that are extremely varied in their morphology and lifestyle. Not only do copepods dominate marine plankton and sediment communities and make up a sizeable component of the freshwater plankton, but over 6,000 species are symbiotically associated with every major phylum of marine metazoans, mostly as parasites. Unfortunately, our understanding of copepod evolutionary relationships is relatively limited in part because of their extremely divergent morphology, sparse taxon sampling in molecular phylogenetic analyses, a reliance on only a handful of molecular markers, and little taxonomic overlap between phylogenetic studies. Here, a synthesis tree method is used to integrate published phylogenies into a more comprehensive tree of copepods by leveraging phylogenetic and taxonomic data. A literature review in this study finds fewer than 500 species of copepods have been sampled in molecular phylogenetic studies. Using the Open Tree of Life platform, those taxa that have been sampled in previous phylogenetic studies are grafted together and combined with the underlying copepod taxonomic hierarchy from the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy to make a synthesis phylogeny of all copepod species. Taxon sampling with respect to molecular phylogenetic analyses is reviewed for all orders of copepods and shows only 3\% of copepod species have been sampled in phylogenetic studies. The resulting synthesis phylogeny reveals copepods have transitioned to a parasitic lifestyle on at least 14 occasions. We examine the underlying phylogenetic, taxonomic, and natural history data supporting these transitions to parasitism; review the species diversity of each parasitic clade; and identify key areas for further phylogenetic investigation.},

  abstract = {Executive SummaryAtmospheric TemperaturesMore than half of the observed increase in global mean surface temperature (GMST) from 1951 to 2010 is very likely due to the observed anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations. The consistency of observed and modeled changes across the climate system, including warming of the atmosphere and ocean, sea level rise, ocean acidification and changes in the water cycle, the cryosphere and climate extremes points to a large-scale warming resulting primarily from anthropogenic increases in GHG concentrations. Solar forcing is the only known natural forcing acting to warm the climate over this period but it has increased much less than GHG forcing, and the observed pattern of long-term tropospheric warming and stratospheric cooling is not consistent with the expected response to solar irradiance variations. The Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) could be a confounding influence but studies that find a significant role for the AMO show that this does not project strongly onto 1951–2010 temperature trends. (10.3.1, Table 10.1) It is extremely likely that human activities caused more than half of the observed increase in GMST from 1951 to 2010. This assessment is supported by robust evidence from multiple studies using different methods. Observational uncertainty has been explored much more thoroughly than previously and the assessment now considers observations from the first decade of the 21st century and simulations from a new generation of climate models whose ability to simulate historical climate has improved in many respects relative to the previous generation of models considered in AR4.},

The impact of climate change on EBUSs and the ecosystems they support is thus a subject of considerable interest. Here, we review hypotheses of climate-driven change in the physics, biogeochemistry, and ecology of EBUSs; describe observed changes over recent decades; and present projected changes over the twenty-first century. Similarities in historical and projected change among EBUSs include a trend toward upwelling intensification in poleward regions, mitigatedwarming in near-coastal regions where upwelling intensifies, and enhanced water-column stratification and a shoaling mixed layer. However, there remains significant uncertainty in how EBUSs will evolve with climate change, particularly in how the sometimes competing changes in upwelling intensity, source-water chemistry, and stratification will affect productivity and ecosystem structure. We summarize the commonalities and differences in historical and projected change in EBUSs and conclude with an assessment of key remaining uncertainties and questions. Future studies will need to address these questions to better understand, project, and adapt to climate-driven changes in EBUSs.},

  abstract = {Global ocean O2 content has varied significantly across the eons, both shaping and being shaped by the evolutionary history of life on planet Earth. Indeed, past O2 fluctuations have been associated with major extinctions and the reorganization of marine biota. Moreover, its most recent iteration—now anthropogenically driven—represents one of the most prominent challenges for both marine ecosystems and human societies, with ocean deoxygenation being regarded as one of the main drivers of global biodiversity loss. Yet ocean deoxygenation has received far less attention than concurrent environmental variables of marine climate change, namely, ocean warming and acidification, particularly in the field of experimental marine ecology. Together with the lack of consistent criteria defining gradual and acute changes in O2 content, a general lack of multifactorial studies featuring all three drivers and their interactions prevents an adequate interpretation of the potential effects of extreme and gradual deoxygenation. We present a comprehensive overview of the interplay between O2 and marine life across space and time and discuss the current knowledge gaps and future steps for deoxygenation research. This work may also contribute to the ongoing call for an integrative perspective on the combined effects of these three drivers of change for marine organisms and ecosystems worldwide.},

  abstract = {Marine life is controlled by multiple physical and chemical drivers and by diverse ecological processes. Many of these oceanic properties are being altered by climate change and other anthropogenic pressures. Hence, identifying the influences of multifaceted ocean change, from local to global scales, is a complex task. To guide policy-making and make projections of the future of the marine biosphere, it is essential to understand biological responses at physiological, evolutionary and ecological levels. Here, we contrast and compare different approaches to multiple driver experiments that aim to elucidate biological responses to a complex matrix of ocean global change. We present the benefits and the challenges of each approach with a focus on marine research, and guidelines to navigate through these different categories to help identify strategies that might best address research questions in fundamental physiology, experimental evolutionary biology and community ecology. Our review reveals that the field of multiple driver research is being pulled in complementary directions: the need for reductionist approaches to obtain process-oriented, mechanistic understanding and a requirement to quantify responses to projected future scenarios of ocean change. We conclude the review with recommendations on how best to align different experimental approaches to contribute fundamental information needed for science-based policy formulation.},

We compiled trait information on marine pelagic copepods, a major group of zooplankton, from the published literature and from experts and organized the data into a structured database. We collected 9306 records for 14 functional traits. Particular attention was given to body size, feeding mode, egg size, spawning strategy, respiration rate, and myelination (presence of nerve sheathing). Most records were reported at the species level, but some phylogenetically conserved traits, such as myelination, were reported at higher taxonomic levels, allowing the entire diversity of around 10\,800 recognized marine copepod species to be covered with a few records. Aside from myelination, data coverage was highest for spawning strategy and body size, while information was more limited for quantitative traits related to reproduction and physiology. The database may be used to investigate relationships between traits, to produce trait biogeographies, or to inform and validate trait-based marine ecosystem models. The data can be downloaded from PANGAEA, doi:10.1594/PANGAEA.862968.},

A wide range of distributions and link functions are supported, allowing users to fit – among others – linear, robust linear, count data, survival, response times, ordinal, zero-inflated, hurdle, and even self-defined mixture models all in a multilevel context. Further modeling options include both theory-driven and data-driven non-linear terms, auto-correlation structures, censoring and truncation, meta-analytic standard errors, and quite a few more. In addition, all parameters of the response distribution can be predicted in order to perform distributional regression. Prior specifications are flexible and explicitly encourage users to apply prior distributions that actually reflect their prior knowledge. Models can easily be evaluated and compared using several methods assessing posterior or prior predictions.

Current eDNA methods require refinement and improved calibration and validation along the entire workflow to lessen false positives/negatives. Moreover, there is great need for a better understanding of the "natural history" of eDNA-its origins, state, lifetime, and transportation- A nd for more detailed insights concerning the physical and ecological limitations of eDNA use. Although eDNA analysis can provide powerful information, particularly in freshwater and marine environments, its impact is likely to be less significant in terrestrial settings.

Behavioral responses that enhance survival of stressed individuals may be critical for local populations to persist. Although the types and intensities of stressors can vary over the geographic range of a species, little is known regarding geographical variation in adaptive behavioral responses to stressors, especially in marine and estuarine species subject to human impact. To explore varied behavior in response to low dissolved oxygen (a human perturbation), we examined two geographically distinct populations of the copepod, Acartia tonsa. Chesapeake Bay copepods, historically exposed to oxygen gradients, avoided hypoxic bottom waters. In contrast, Florida copepods not typically exposed to hypoxia did not avoid lethal oxygen concentrations. Our results suggest that local behavioral adaptations may result from consequences of anthropogenic perturbations and may limit the ability to apply biological data across regions. Geographical differences in behavioral responses of important prey species may also result in geographic variation in the severity of disruption of aquatic food webs.},

In addition to concentrating carbon in the deep sea, the biological pump also significantly affects the distribution of a number of different chemical constituents of ocean water. There is keen interest in being able to predict both the overall capacity and the efficiency of the biological pump in different places and at different times (including in the future). The physical environment, the type of phytoplankton present, the activities of zooplankton, the presence of biominerals and clay minerals, and the structure of the food web all play important roles in determining both the capacity and efficiency of the biological pump on local and regional scales, complicating efforts to portray the biological pump in models.},

  abstract = {Early life stages of salmonids are particularly vulnerable to warming and hypoxia, which are common stressors in hyporheic, gravel bed, rearing habitat (i.e. a ‘redd’). With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures [10°C (ambient) and 14°C (warm)] and two oxygen levels [normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10 mg O2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects. These results suggest that both warming and hypoxia are important factors to address in conservation strategies for Chinook salmon.},

We show that the spatial extent of hypoxia is highly sensitive to small changes in the ocean’s O2 content, with maximum responses at suboxic concentrations where anaerobic metabolisms predominate. In model-based reconstructions of historical oxygen changes, the world’s largest suboxic zone, in the Pacific Ocean, varies in size by a factor of 2. This is attributable to climate-driven changes in the depth of the tropical and subtropical thermocline that have multiplicative effects on respiration rates in low-O2 water. The same mechanism yields even larger fluctuations in the rate of nitrogen removal by denitrification, creating a link between decadal climate oscillations and the nutrient limitation of marine photosynthesis.},

Human industrialization is intensifying the aerobic challenges to marine ecosystems by depleting the ocean's O               2               inventory through the global addition of heat and local addition of nutrients. Historical observations reveal an ∼2\% decline in upper-ocean O               2               and accelerating reports of coastal mass mortality events. The dynamic balance of O               2               supply and demand provides a unifying framework for understanding these phenomena across scales from the global ocean to individual organisms. Using this framework, we synthesize recent advances in forecasting O               2               loss and its impacts on marine biogeography, biodiversity, and biogeochemistry. We also highlight three outstanding uncertainties: how long-term global climate change intensifies ocean weather events in which simultaneous heat and hypoxia create metabolic storms, how differential species O               2               sensitivities alter the structure of ecological communities, and how global O               2               loss intersects with coastal eutrophication. Projecting these interacting impacts on future marine ecosystems requires integration of climate dynamics, biogeochemistry, physiology, and ecology, evaluated with an eye on Earth history. Reducing global and local impacts of warming and O               2               loss will be essential if humankind is to preserve the health and biodiversity of the future ocean.},

The haddock larvae exploited a wider range of prey types, and at comparable lengths they consumed smaller and slower moving organisms than did the other gadoid larvae. The diets of sandeels and long rough dab which were abundant in the area were also examined. The species-specific selectivity patterns with respect to size and mobility of prey fell into two categories: those dictated by the basic body morphology, and those determined by behavioural factors, which were intimately linked to adult behavioural patterns. Competition for food was potentially possible between late larvae, but it could not be identified as a factor causing shifts in dietary characteristics.},

Data were collected on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-a and zooplankton taxonomic abundances. Environmental conditions were largely related to the influence of the Mississippi River plume. The zooplankton community was numerically dominated by copepods, with various meroplankton and other non-copepod zooplankton present in lower abundances. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups of co-occurring zooplankton taxa. Two of these were numerically dominant, one characterized by the copepod Acartia spp. and a second consisting of several copepod taxa (including larger-bodied genera) and salps. Relative to the group containing Acartia spp., this second dominant group was more abundant at higher salinity, lower temperature and greater vertical extent of hypoxic water into the water column above the seafloor. Dissolved oxygen, as vertical extent of hypoxia, was of comparable importance to temperature and salinity in predicting the abundances of zooplankton taxa. Variability of the zooplankton community with environmental conditions, and particularly the greater abundance of larger taxa in association with hypoxia, has implications for the contribution of zooplankton-mediated vertical flux to oxygen drawdown, and for the quality of the food environment for larval and other planktivorous fish.},

  abstract = {We describe a model predicting the effects of low environmental oxygen on vital rates (egg production, somatic growth, and mortality) of the coastal planktonic copepod Acartia tonsa. Hypoxic conditions can result in respiration rate being directly limited by oxygen availability. We hypothesized that A. tonsa egg production, somatic growth, and ingestion rates would all respond in a similar manner to low oxygen conditions, as a result of oxygen dependent changes in respiration rate. Rate data for A. tonsa egg production, somatic growth, and ingestion under low environmental oxygen were compiled from the literature and from supplementary experiments. The response of these rates to oxygen was compared by converting all to the analogous units in terms of oxygen utilization, which we termed analogous respiration rate. These analogous respiration rates, along with published measurements of respiration rates, were used to parameterize and evaluate the relationship between A. tonsa respiration rate and environmental oxygen. At 18°C, our results suggest that A. tonsa experiences sub-lethal effects of hypoxia below an oxygen partial pressure of 8.1 kPa (∼3.1 mg L−1 = 2.3 mL L−1). The results of this study can be used to predict the effects of hypoxia on A. tonsa growth and mortality as related to environmental temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Such predictions will be useful as a way to incorporate the effects of coastal hypoxia into population, community, or ecosystem level models that include A. tonsa. This approach can also be used to characterize the effects of hypoxia on other aquatic organisms.},

  abstract = {We present a compilation of apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) changes observed in the upper pycnocline of the North Pacific Ocean over the last several decades. The goal here is to place previously-published data in a common format, and assess the causes of the observed changes. The general trend along repeat cross sections of the eastern and western subtropical ocean and the subarctic ocean is an increase in AOU from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s. AOU has also been increasing in a time-series study in the northwest subarctic Ocean off of Japan since the late 1960s. Observed AOU changes south of 35°N in the subtropical ocean are 10–20 μmol kg−1, with much greater changes, reaching 60–80 μmol kg−1 in isolated areas, in the subtropical/subarctic boundary and the subarctic ocean. Analysis of changes in both AOU and salinity on isopycnals suggests that there are significant salinity-normalized increases that must be due to alteration in the rate of ventilation or organic matter degradation. A common feature in the data is that the maximum increase in AOU is centered near the density horizon σθ= 26.6. Time series results from the Oyashio Current region near the winter outcrop area of this density horizon indicate that surface waters there have become fresher with time, which may mean this density surface has ceased to outcrop in the latter decades of the 20th century. Whether this is due to natural decadal-scale changes or anthropogenic influences can be decided by determining future trends in AOU on these density surfaces.},

Copepods and pteropods exhibited strong but divergent responses in the same habitat; copepods had higher oxygen-reactive absorbance capacity, glutathione-S-transferase, and total glutathione content. The ratio between reduced to oxidised glutathione was higher in copepods than in pteropods, indicating lower oxidative stress in copepods. Pteropods showed higher activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation, indicating increased antioxidant defences and oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant defence system of the copepods has a greater capacity to respond to oxidative stress, while pteropods already face severe stress and show limited capacity to deal with further changes. The results suggest that copepods have higher adaptive potential, owing to their stronger vertical migration behaviour and efficient glutathione metabolism, whereas pteropods run the risk of oxidative stress and mortality under high CO 2 conditions. Our results provide a unique dataset and evidence of stress-inducing mechanisms behind pteropod ocean acidification responses. © 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The Arctic region is undergoing rapid and significant changes, characterized by high rates of acidification and warming. These transformations prompt critical questions about the resilience of marine communities in the face of environmental change. In the Arctic, marine zooplankton and in particular calanoid copepods play a vital role in the food web. Changes in environmental conditions could disrupt zooplankton communities, posing detrimental consequences for the entire ecosystem. Copepod early-life stages have been shown to be particularly sensitive to environmental stressors since they represent a bottleneck in the life cycle. Here, we investigated the responses of 4-day old Calanus hyperboreus nauplii when exposed to acidification (pH 7.5 and 8.1) and warming (0 and 3°C), both independently and in combination. Naupliar respiration rates increased when exposed to a combination of acidification and warming, but not when exposed to the stressors individually. Moreover, we found no discernible differences in lipid content and fatty acid (FA) composition of the nauplii across the different experimental treatments. Wax esters accounted for approximately 75\% of the lipid reserves, and high amounts of long chain fatty acids 20:1 and 22:1, crucial for the reproduction cycle in copepods, were also detected. Our results indicate a sensitivity of these nauplii to a combination of acidification and warming, but not to the individual stressors, aligning with a growing body of evidence from related studies. This study sheds light on the potential implications of global change for Arctic copepod populations by elucidating the responses of early-life stages to these environmental stressors.

The most important of these is modularity: Building systems incrementally from independent components with minimal interdependence. This approach prioritizes function and helps avoid overtaxing development resources. It also enables a desirable outcome: The use of four-dimensional ocean forecast information beyond the original purpose. Such extensions may include carbon cycle research, harmful algal bloom (HAB) prediction, maritime operational support, anticipation of fishing conditions and nutrient upwelling events, and more, in addition to unanticipated uses of the forecast data.},

Available prey consisted of protists (diatoms, dinoflagellates, aloricate ciliates, and loricate ciliates) and metazoans (trochophores, bivalve larvae, rotifers, copepod nauplii, and gastropod larvae). We used a prey enumeration technique that included soft-bodied heterotrophic protists (aloricate ciliates and athecate dinoflagellates) in the diet. We observed significant consumption of aloricate ciliates, loricate ciliates, bivalve larvae, dinoflagellates, and other available prey 73–200 μm. Clearance rates (mL larva−1 h−1) and an electivity index E* were used as measures of prey selectivity. The herring larvae showed strong selection for bivalve larvae and 73–200 μm available prey; however, across all valid experiments, protist prey were selected for at rates comparable to metazoans. Ingestion rates (μg C larva−1 h−1) showed that the majority of larval carbon intake was from diatoms and aloricate ciliates. The results of this study illustrate that there is a direct trophic link between larval herring and the microbial food web, and protists may make up a substantial portion of the larval fish diet, possibly alleviating food limitation.},

Whereas anthropogenic nutrient loading has increased the frequency and severity of hypoxia in estuaries and semi-enclosed seas3,4, the occurrence of hypoxia in open-coast upwelling systems reflects ocean conditions that control the delivery of oxygen-poor and nutrient-rich deep water onto continental shelves1. Upwelling systems support a large proportion of the world's fisheries5, therefore understanding the links between changes in ocean climate, upwelling-driven hypoxia and ecological perturbations is critical. Here we report on the unprecedented development of severe inner-shelf ({$<$}70\,m) hypoxia and resultant mass die-offs of fish and invertebrates within the California Current System. In 2002, cross-shelf transects revealed the development of abnormally low dissolved-oxygen levels as a response to anomalously strong flow of subarctic water into the California Current System. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of inner-shelf ecosystems to variation in ocean conditions, and the potential impacts of climate change on marine communities.},

We measured abundances of the calanoid copepod Calanus pacificus in relation to oxygen concentrations in the field and established its tolerance to low dissolved oxygen (DO) in the laboratory. In situ distributions of female C. pacificus were assessed with depth-stratified net sampling in Hood Canal, a seasonally hypoxic sub-estuary of Puget Sound, Washington. No clear avoidance of DO levels from supersaturated down to 2.0 mg DO L−1 was observed; DO levels~\&lt;2 mg L−1 were rare in our sampling. In the lab, at 13°C female C. pacificus exhibited 100\% 24-h survival at DO levels down to 1.7 mg DO L−1; below 1.5 mg DO L−1, survival sharply declined, with 25\% survival at 1.2 mg L−1 and complete mortality within 1 h at 0.9 mg L−1. Calanus pacificus is one of the dominant copepods throughout much of the North Pacific and an important trophic link in the ecosystem. Our measurements indicate that they have a steep threshold in oxygen tolerance that is similar to those measured for other calanoid copepods and which could limit their habitat in years of severe oxygen depletion.},

  abstract = {Seasonal changes in environmental conditions require substantial physiological responses for population persistence. Phenotypic plasticity is a common mechanism to tolerate these changes, but for organisms with short generation times rapid adaptation may also be a contributing factor. Here, we used a common garden design (11~°C and 18~°C) to disentangle the impacts of adaptation from phenotypic plasticity on thermal tolerance of the calanoid copepod Acartia hudsonica collected throughout spring and summer of a single year. Acartia hudsonica were collected from five time points across the season and thermal tolerance was determined using critical thermal maximum CTmax followed by additional measurements after one generation of common garden. As sea surface temperature increased through the season, field collected individuals showed corresponding increases in thermal tolerance but decreases in body size. Despite different thermal tolerances of wild collections, after one generation of common garden animals did not differ in CTmax within thermal treatments. Instead, there was evidence of phenotypic plasticity where higher temperatures were tolerated by the 18~°C versus the 11~°C treatment animals across all collections. Despite persisting differences between collections due to either adaptation or parental effects, acclimation also had significant effects on body size, with the warm treatment resulting in smaller individuals, consistent with the temperature size rule. Therefore, the differences in thermal tolerance and body size observed in field collected A. hudsonica were predominantly driven by plasticity rather than adaptation. However, the observed decrease in body size suggests that nutrient availability for higher trophic levels and ecosystem functioning could be impacted if temperatures consistently increase with no change in copepod abundance. This is the first record of A. hudsonica in the Baltic Sea known to the authors.},

  abstract = {Respirometry is a ubiquitous practice in experimental biology, but there is a lack of standard practices when analysing the resulting data, limiting transparency and reproducibility. As respirometry datasets become increasingly large and analytical approaches more complex, manipulating the data remains a challenge and often intractable with existing tools. Here we describe the respR R package, a collection of functions that implement a workflow-based approach to automate the analysis and visualisation of respirometry data. The package can be used for closed, intermittent flow, flow-through and open-tank respirometry and uses well-defined sets of rules to reliably and rapidly generate reproducible results. We demonstrate how respR uses novel computing methods such as rolling regressions and kernel density estimates to reliably detect maximum, minimum and most linear sections of the data, and critical oxygen tension, . Although designed specifically with aquatic respirometry in mind, the object-oriented approach of the package and the unit-less nature of its analytical functions mean that parts of the package can easily be used to estimate linear relationships from a range of applications in many research disciplines.},

This globally averaged oxygen decrease is −0.93 ± 0.23μmol l−1, which is equivalent to annual oxygen losses of −0.55 ± 0.13 × 1014 mol yr−1(100–1000 m). The strongest decreases in oxygen occur in the mid-latitudes of both hemispheres, near regions where there is strong water renewal and exchange between the ocean interior and surface waters. Approximately 15\% of global oxygen decrease can be explained by a warmer mixed-layer reducing the capacity of water to store oxygen, while the remainder is consistent with an overall decrease in the exchange between surface waters and the ocean interior. Here we suggest that this reduction in water mass renewal rates on a global scale is a consequence of increased stratification caused by warmer surface waters. These observations support climate model simulations of oxygen change under global warming scenarios.},

  abstract = {Ocean processes are generally large scale on the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast; this is true of both seasonal variations and event-scale upwelling-downwelling fluctuations., which are highly energetic. Coastal upwelling supplies most of the macronutrients available for production, although the intensity of upwelling-favorable wind forcing increases southward while primary production and chlorophyll are higher in the north, off the Washington coast. This discrepancy could be related to several mesoscale features: the wider, more gently sloping shelf to the north, the existence of numerous submarine canyons to the north, the availability of Columbia River plume water and sediment north of the river mouth, and the existence of a semi-permanent eddy offshore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We suggest that these features have important effects on the magnitude and timing of macronutrient or micronutrient delivery to the plankton. These features are potentially important as well to transport pathways and residence times of planktonic larvae and to the development of harmful algal blooms. The coastal plain estuaries, with the exception of the Columbia River, are relatively small, with large tidal forcing and highly seasonal direct river inputs that are low to negligible during the growing season. Primary production in these estuaries is likely controlled not by river-driven stratification but by coastal upwelling and exchange with the ocean. Both baroclinic mechanisms (the gravitational circulation) and barotropic ones (lateral stirring by tide and, possibly, wind) contribute to this exchange. Because estuarine hydrography and ecology are so dominated by ocean signals, the coastal estuaries, like the coastal ocean, are largely synchronous on seasonal and event time scales, though, intrusions of the Columbia River plume can cause strong asymmetries between Washington and Oregon estuaries especially during spring downwelling conditions. Water property correlation increases between spring and summer as wind forcing becomes more spatially coherent along the coast. Estuarine habitat is structure not only, by large scale forcing but also by fine scale processes in the extensive intertidal zone, such as by solar heating or differential advection by tidal, curents.},

Across the traits of diverse animals, Φ exhibits strong seasonal to interdecadal variations throughout the CCS, implying that resident species already experience large fluctuations in available aerobic habitat. For a key CCS species, northern anchovy, the long-term biogeographic distribution and decadal fluctuations in abundance are both highly coherent with aerobic habitat volume. Ocean warming and oxygen loss by 2100 are projected to decrease Φ below critical levels in 30 to 50\% of anchovies’ present range, including complete loss of aerobic habitat—and thus likely extirpation—from the southern CCS. Aerobic habitat loss will vary widely across the traits of CCS taxa, disrupting ecological interactions throughout the region.},

  abstract = {Changes in dissolved O2 observed across the world oceans in recent decades have been interpreted as a response of marine biogeochemistry to climate change. Little is known however about the spectrum of oceanic O2 variability. Using an idealized model, we illustrate how fluctuations in ocean circulation and biological respiration lead to low-frequency variability of thermocline oxygen. Because the ventilation of the thermocline naturally integrates the effects of anomalous respiration and advection over decadal timescales, short-lived O2 perturbations are strongly damped, producing a red spectrum, even in a randomly varying oceanic environment. This background red spectrum of O2 suggests a new interpretation of the ubiquitous strength of decadal oxygen variability and provides a null hypothesis for the detection of climate change influence on oceanic oxygen. We find a statistically significant spectral peak at a 15–20 year timescale in the subpolar North Pacific, but the mechanisms connecting to climate variability remain uncertain.},

Additional quality control is applied, and the resultant oxygen anomaly field is used to quantify upper ocean O2 trends at global and hemispheric scales. A widespread negative O2 trend is beginning to emerge from the envelope of interannual variability. Ocean reanalysis data are used to evaluate relationships with changes in ocean heat content (OHC) and oxygen solubility (O2,sat). Global O2 decline is evident after the 1980s, accompanied by an increase in global OHC. The global upper ocean O2 inventory (0–1000 m) changed at the rate of −243 ± 124 T mol O2 per decade. Further, the O2 inventory is negatively correlated with the OHC (r = −0.86; 0–1000 m) and the regression coefficient of O2 to OHC is approximately −8.2 ± 0.66 nmol O2 J−1, on the same order of magnitude as the simulated O2-heat relationship typically found in ocean climate models. Variability and trends in the observed upper ocean O2 concentration are dominated by the apparent oxygen utilization component with relatively small contributions from O2,sat. This indicates that changing ocean circulation, mixing, and/or biochemical processes, rather than the direct thermally induced solubility effects, are the primary drivers for the observed O2 changes. The spatial patterns of the multidecadal trend include regions of enhanced ocean deoxygenation including the subpolar North Pacific, eastern boundary upwelling systems, and tropical oxygen minimum zones. Further studies are warranted to understand and attribute the global O2 trends and their regional expressions.},

In lieu of ad hoc data adjustments, we describe and evaluate a zero-and-one inflated Dirichlet regression model, with its corresponding R package (zoid), capable of handling observed data x\textbackslash{} x \textbackslash{} consisting of three possible categories: zeros, proportions, or ones. Instead of fitting the model to observations of single biological units (e.g., individual organisms) within a sample, we sum proportional contributions across units and estimate mixture proportions using one aggregated observation per sample. Optional estimation of overdispersion and covariate influences expand model applications. We evaluate model performance, as implemented in Stan, using simulations and two ecological case studies. We show that zoid successfully estimates mixture proportions using simulated data with varying sample sizes and is robust to overdispersion and covariate structure. In empirical case studies, we estimate the composition of a mixed-stock Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fishery and analyze the stomach contents of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). Our implementation of the model as an R package facilitates its application to varied ecological data sets composed of proportional observations.},

  abstract = {Within the eastern tropical oceans of the Atlantic and Pacific basin vast oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) exist in the depth range between 100 and 900m. Minimum oxygen values are reached at 300–500m depth which in the eastern Pacific become suboxic (dissolved oxygen content {$<$}4.5μmolkg−1) with dissolved oxygen concentration of less than 1μmolkg−1. The OMZ of the eastern Atlantic is not suboxic and has relatively high oxygen minimum values of about 17μmolkg−1 in the South Atlantic and more than 40μmolkg−1 in the North Atlantic. About 20 (40\%) of the North Pacific volume is occupied by an OMZ when using 45μmolkg−1 (or 90μmolkg−1, respectively) as an upper bound for OMZ oxygen concentration for ocean densities lighter than σθ{$<$}27.2kgm−3. The relative volumes reduce to less than half for the South Pacific (7\% and 13\%, respectively). The abundance of OMZs are considerably smaller (1\% and 7\%) for the South Atlantic and only ∼0\% and 5\% for the North Atlantic. Thermal domes characterized by upward displacements of isotherms located in the northeastern Pacific and Atlantic and in the southeastern Atlantic are co-located with the centres of the OMZs. They seem not to be directly involved in the generation of the OMZs. OMZs are a consequence of a combination of weak ocean ventilation, which supplies oxygen, and respiration, which consumes oxygen. Oxygen consumption can be approximated by the apparent oxygen utilization (AOU). However, AOU scaled with an appropriate consumption rate (aOUR) gives a time, the oxygen age. Here we derive oxygen ages using climatological AOU data and an empirical estimate of aOUR. Averaging oxygen ages for main thermocline isopycnals of the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean exhibit an exponential increase with density without an obvious signature of the OMZs. Oxygen supply originates from a surface outcrop area and can also be approximated by the turn-over time, the ratio of ocean volume to ventilating flux. The turn-over time corresponds well to the average oxygen ages for the well ventilated waters. However, in the density ranges of the suboxic OMZs the turn-over time substantially increases. This indicates that reduced ventilation in the outcrop is directly related to the existence of suboxic OMZs, but they are not obviously related to enhanced consumption indicated by the oxygen ages. The turn-over time suggests that the lower thermocline of the North Atlantic would be suboxic but at present this is compensated by the import of water from the well ventilated South Atlantic. The turn-over time approach itself is independent of details of ocean transport pathways. Instead the geographical location of the OMZ is to first order determined by: (i) the patterns of upwelling, either through Ekman or equatorial divergence, (ii) the regions of general sluggish horizontal transport at the eastern boundaries, and (iii) to a lesser extent to regions with high productivity as indicated through ocean colour data.},

  abstract = {Oceans general circulation models predict that global warming may cause a decrease in the oceanic O2 inventory and an associated O2 outgassing. An independent argument is presented here in support of this prediction based on observational evidence of the ocean's biogeochemical response to natural warming. On time scales from seasonal to centennial, natural O2 flux/heat flux ratios are shown to occur in a range of 2 to 10 nmol of O2 per joule of warming, with larger ratios typically occurring at higher latitudes and over longer time scales. The ratios are several times larger than would be expected solely from the effect of heating on the O2 solubility, indicating that most of the O2 exchange is biologically mediated through links between heating and stratification. The change in oceanic O2 inventory through the 1990s is estimated to be 0.3 ± 0.4 × 1014 mol of O2 per year based on scaling the observed anomalous long-term ocean warming by natural O2 flux/heating ratios and allowing for uncertainty due to decadal variability. Implications are discussed for carbon budgets based on observed changes in atmospheric O2/N2 ratio and based on observed changes in ocean dissolved inorganic carbon.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the temporal and spatial variation of the zooplankton community of a hypoxic coastal embayment (Amvrakikos Gulf, western Greece) in relation to hydrological characteristics during an annual cycle. The main hydrological feature was the prolonged water stratification, which determined hypoxic conditions in the deeper layers that became anoxic close to the bottom in September, while vertical mixing occurred for a very short period (October-November). The total zooplankton abundance fluctuated between 44.6 and 159.7 ind l-1. Fourteen groups were recorded, among which copepods dominated accounting on average for 86.4 \%. Most of the groups presented higher abundance values in winter and spring when increased chlorophyll-α concentrations were found. Oxygen depletion affects the vertical distribution of most zooplankton groups and the vertical habitat partitioning between copepod orders and their ontogenetic stages. Several taxa were recorded even in the deep, anoxic layers, but only the polychaete larvae increased in abundance with depth. Calanoids, appendicularians and bivalve larvae presented eastward decrease of abundance in the deepest layers following the same pattern of oxygen decrease. Notwithstanding hypoxic conditions in its deepest layers, Amvrakikos Gulf was accounted for a mesotrophic ecosystem, with the nutrient concentration being lower than in the past. Several biotic elements indicate that the gulf is in a transitional phase towards a better quality state and these results reinforce the need for consistent monitoring of this ecosystem.},

Depth-stratified zooplankton net tows were conducted above and below the oxycline during day and night in midsummer (July), late summer (September), and early winter (December) 2008 using closing nets. Bottom DO concentrations declined slowly through summer. In July, DO at most stations was low but not hypoxic. By late summer, bottom waters throughout the study area were hypoxic (≤ 2 mg L−1) and were severely hypoxic ({$<$} 1 mg L−1) at some stations. In winter, water-column mixing and lower surface primary production resulted in higher DO, although sub-pycnocline hypoxia persisted through December at some locations. Zooplankton abundance decreased from midsummer to winter. The community was dominated by gelatinous zooplankton and copepods. A shift in community structure towards a higher dominance of polychaetes and the cyclopoid copepod Oithona similis occurred over the season. Temporal and spatial patterns in zooplankton communities were primarily structured by month and bottom depth. DO played a lesser role in structuring the species composition, but vertical distributions of several taxa changed in response to hypoxia, with a greater proportion of their populations found above the oxycline during both day and night where bottom oxygen was low. However, some taxa were abundant below the oxycline, even at oxygen levels {$<$} 0.5 mg L−1; these taxa may have a high tolerance to hypoxia, use low-oxygen regions as a predation refuge, and be useful indicators of poor water-quality conditions.},

We explored three of those that are focused on how zooplankton composition or biomass is affected by seasonal hypoxia using data collected over two summers in Hood Canal, a seasonally-hypoxic sub-basin of Puget Sound, Washington. We conducted hydrographic profiles and zooplankton net tows at four stations, from a region in the south that annually experiences moderate hypoxia to a region in the north where oxygen remains above hypoxic levels. The specific hypotheses tested were that low oxygen leads to: (1) increased dominance of gelatinous relative to crustacean zooplankton, (2) increased dominance of cyclopoid copepods relative to calanoid copepods, and (3) overall decreased zooplankton abundance and biomass at hypoxic sites compared to where oxygen levels are high. Additionally, we examined whether the temporal stability of community structure was decreased by hypoxia. We found evidence of a shift toward more gelatinous zooplankton and lower total zooplankton abundance and biomass at hypoxic sites, but no clear increase in the dominance of cyclopoid relative to calanoid copepods. We also found the lowest variance in community structure at the most hypoxic site, in contrast to our prediction. Hypoxia can fundamentally alter marine ecosystems, but the impacts differ among systems.},

In general, eDNA studies that rely on amplicon sequencing may detect hundreds of species present in a sampled environment, but the resulting species composition can be idiosyncratic, reflecting species’ true biomass abundances poorly or not at all. Here, we use a set of simulations to develop a mechanistic understanding of the processes leading to the kinds of results common in mixed-template PCR-based (metabarcoding) studies. In particular, we focus on the effects of PCR cycle number and primer amplification efficiency on the results of diversity metrics in sequencing studies. We then show that proportional indices of amplicon reads capture trends in taxon biomass with high accuracy, particularly where amplification efficiency is high (median correlation up to 0.97). Our results explain much of the observed behavior of PCR-based studies, and lead to recommendations for best practices in the field.},

Under laboratory conditions the 6 groups examined (2 polychaetes 1 oligochaete, 1 archiannelid, 1 mystacocarid and 1 harpacticoid copepod) show a high sensitivity to hydrogen sulfid and a bad tolerance to a low ambient oxygen (below 0.5 ml O2/l). Above this critical limit they are more tolerant and different groups are considered either stenoxybiontic or euroxybiontic. The Cartesian diver microrespirometer is used to determine the oxygen consumption of the interstitial groups. A technique for filling divers with different gas mixtures is described. A distinction between metabolic regulators and metabolic conformers can be made for some species, other have complex metabolic rates. The euroxybiontic regulators Stygocapitella subterranea and Marionina achaeta show highest tolerance to low oxygen tension; this adaptive character enables these species to live at a high level of the sandy beach which is known as an oxygen-deficient habitat. The complex metabolic types, Protodriloides symbioticus and Hesionides arenaria are well adapted to resist in poor oxygenated habitat, they tend nevertheless to be more adapted to live in a fully oxidized sand, i.e. in the lower part of the semi-stable beach. Finally, Derocheilocaris remanei and Paraleptastacus spinicauda are stenoxybionts and conformers in low ambient oxygen; they require a fully oxidized biotope; the “high energy beach” being the appropriate habitat},

As a major component of the cycle, oceans are now experiencing widespread declines in oxygen concentrations. Here, based on model simulations we found that ocean deoxygenation occurs as a result of oceanic oxygen outgassing, which is tightly related with the marine warming. Although the O2 flux from the ocean to atmosphere is quite small compared with that of oceanic oxygen production, this outgassing accounts for almost all of the decline in marine oxygen and even exceeds the amount of the loss. The model projections indicate accelerated oxygen escape from the ocean under climate change. The oceanic outgassing will increase from 1.6 to 4.3 Gt/yr over the 21st century due to solubility and circulation changes related with warming, which may eventually lead to a more hypoxic ocean in the future.},

Here, we quantify changes in ocean stratification down to depths of 2,000\,m using the squared buoyancy frequency N2 and newly available ocean temperature/salinity observations. We find that stratification globally has increased by a substantial 5.3\% [5.0\%, 5.8\%] in recent decades (1960–2018) (the confidence interval is 5–95\%); a rate of 0.90\% per decade. Most of the increase (\textasciitilde 71\%) occurred in the upper 200\,m of the ocean and resulted largely ({$>$}90\%) from temperature changes, although salinity changes play an important role locally.},

Beta regression based on the beta distribution can be used to model a response variable \$y\$ that takes values in open unit interval \$(0, 1)\$. Zero/one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression models can be applied when \$y\$ takes values from closed unit interval \$[0,1]\$.

The statistical methodology underlying the *zoib* package is discussed, the functions covered by the package are outlined, and the usage of the package is illustrated with three examples of different data and model types. The package is comprehensive and versatile in that it can model data with or without inflation at 0 or 1, accommodate clustered and correlated data via latent variables, perform penalized regression as needed, and allow for model comparison via the computation of the DIC criterion.},

However, major uncertainties still remain regarding the position of iconic taxa such as Branchiopoda, Copepoda, Remipedia, and Cephalocarida, and the sister group relationship of hexapods. We assembled the most taxon-rich phylogenomic pancrustacean data set to date and analyzed it using a variety of methodological approaches. We prioritized low levels of missing data and found that some clades were consistently recovered independently of the analytical approach used. These include, for example, Oligostraca and Altocrustacea. Substantial support was also found for Allotriocarida, with Remipedia as the sister of Hexapoda (i.e., Labiocarida), and Branchiopoda as the sister of Labiocarida, a clade that we name Athalassocarida (=”nonmarine shrimps”). Within Allotriocarida, Cephalocarida was found as the sister of Athalassocarida. Finally, moderate support was found for Hexanauplia (Copepoda as sister to Thecostraca) in alliance with Malacostraca. Mapping key crustacean tagmosis patterns and developmental characters across the revised phylogeny suggests that the ancestral pancrustacean was relatively short-bodied, with extreme body elongation and anamorphic development emerging later in pancrustacean evolution.},

When such eggs were subsequently exposed to normal oxygen concentrations, hatching varied among the species, indicating variability in the capacity of eggs to survive exposure to low oxygen. Incubation of eggs at low oxygen concentrations resulted in an increase in the duration of embryonic development. Experiments were conducted in closed systems and oxygen concentration was determined by thermal conductivity using gas chromatography.},

  abstract = {The local zooplankton communities that inhabit a several-hundred kilometer-wide band along the eastern margin of the North Pacific typically include mixtures of species endemic to both nearshore and open-ocean environments. Many have behavioral and life-history adaptations that enhance their probability of survival and retention in either nearshore or offshore regions. Transects across the continental margin typically show a gradient in community composition from primarily nearshore to primarily oceanic, and this gradient is usually steepest near the continental shelf break. However, the transition is often neither monotonic nor complete. Barriers to exchange of water and organisms across this transition are leaky and variable in their location and effectiveness. In this paper, we review mechanisms and consequences of shelf–offshore exchange of zooplankton. Many of these processes vary in sign and intensity with latitude and also in time (wind events, seasonal cycle, and interannual). In general, surface-layer transport of zooplankton is more likely to be seaward in summer and in lower-latitude “upwelling” regions, more likely to be shoreward in winter and in higher-latitude “downwelling” regions. Because zooplankton life cycles and depth distributions are also strongly seasonal, there are important interactions that could potentially drive large match–mismatch variations in distribution and survivorship of both zooplankton and their predators.},

Copepods, especially the naupliar stages, are important pelagic food web components, yet only a few studies have considered the effect of reduced DO concentrations on their survival and population dynamics. This study considers the impact of both lethal and sublethal DO concentrations on copepods. Acartia tonsa were reared at 25 °C at saturating DO (normoxic control) and reduced (hypoxic) DO concentrations of 1.5 or 0.7 ml l−1. Oxygen concentrations were maintained in replicate flasks, by bubbling seawater with air (control), or mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. Egg production, but not survival, was significantly higher in the controls compared to the 1.5 ml l−1 DO treatment. Survival and egg production were significantly lower at 0.7 ml l−1 DO compared to the control. The results suggest that the sublethal as well as the lethal effects of hypoxia may have important repercussions on population and community dynamics in coastal systems.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to provide a database of the incipient lethal concentrations for reduced dissolved oxygen (DO) for selected marine and estuarine species including 12 species of fish, 9 crustaceans, and 1 bivalve. All species occur in the Virginian Province, USA, which is a cold temperate region. The study period was August 1987 to September 1995. Standard bioassay procedures were employed, with most tests being of 4-day duration. Up to eight lethal concentrations (LCs) between LC05 and LC95 were estimated. The study provides four general conclusions about determining lethal thresholds of low DO for these organisms. First, the concentration response curve of most species did not change greatly beyond day 1 of the exposure with the exception of crustacean larvae, which were usually more sensitive on day 4, possibly due to molting. Second, acute LC50 values (1- to 4-day) for low DO were influenced by life-stage and habitat, with pelagic larvae generally being the most sensitive and benthic juveniles the least. Species mean LC50 values ranged from 1.4 to 3.3 mg l–1 for larvae, 1.0 to 2.2 mg l–1 for postlarvae, and 0.5 to 1.6 mg l–1 for juveniles. No intraspecific differences in LC50 were detected between larval stages in crustaceans or with age in larval fishes. The response range between LC05 and LC95 was narrowest for the least sensitive organisms (0.6 mg l–1), and broadened with sensitivity. The mean LC10:LC50 ratio for all species was 1.32 for larvae and juveniles, and 1.36 for postlarvae. The ratio for postlarvae represents only four species, and hence is not considered different from the other life stages. Third, variability increased with increased species and life stage sensitivity to low DO, and with endpoints of LC15 and below, which reduces the certainty of some of these results. Lastly, no influence of temperatures between 20°C and 30°C was detected in a small set of tests with thermally acclimated crustacean larvae. This data set has been used to describe protection limits for juvenile and adult survival, and for larval recruitment for the case of persistent (≥24 h) low DO for estuarine and coastal waters of the Virginian Province, USA.},

  abstract = {There is strong correlative evidence that variation in the growth and survival of secondary consumers is related to the copepod species composition within the Northern California Current. Potential mechanisms driving these correlations include: (1) enhanced growth and survival of secondary consumers when lipid-rich, boreal copepod species are abundant, with cascading effects on higher trophic levels; (2) the regulation of growth and condition of primary and secondary consumers by the relative proportion of certain essential fatty acids (FAs) in primary producers; or (3) a combination of these factors. Disentangling the relative importance of taxonomic composition, lipid quantity, and FA composition on the nutritional quality of copepods requires detailed information on both the consumer and primary producers. Therefore, we collected phytoplankton and copepods at an oceanographic station for 19months and completed species community analyses and generated detailed lipid profiles, including lipid classes and FAs, for both groups. There was strong covariation between species and biochemistry within and across trophic levels and distinct seasonal differences. The amount of total lipid within both the phytoplankton and copepod communities was twice as high in spring and summer than in fall and winter, and certain FAs, such as diatom indicators 20:5ω3 and 16:1ω7, comprised a greater proportion of the FA pool in spring and summer. Indicators of bacterial production within the copepod community were proportionally twice as high during fall and winter than spring and summer. Seasonal transitions in copepod FA composition were consistently offset from transitions in copepod species composition by approximately two weeks. The timing of the seasonal transition in copepod FAs reflected seasonal shifts in the species composition and/or biochemistry of primary producers more than seasonal shifts in the copepod species composition. These results emphasize the importance of interactions between the copepod community and their available phytoplankton prey in regulating the nutritional quality of primary consumers.},

This article reviews the current status of eDNA metabarcoding (simultaneous detection of multiple species) as a noninvasive and cost-effective approach for monitoring marine fish communities and discusses the prospects for this growing field. eDNA metabarcoding coamplifies short fragments of fish eDNA across a wide variety of taxa and, coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, allows massively parallel sequencing to be performed simultaneously for dozens to hundreds of samples. It can predict species richness in a given area, detect habitat segregation and biogeographic patterns from small to large spatial scales, and monitor the spatiotemporal dynamics of fish communities. In addition, it can detect an anthropogenic impact on fish communities through evaluation of their functional diversity. Recognizing the strengths and limitations of eDNA metabarcoding will help ensure that continuous biodiversity monitoring at multiple sites will be useful for ecosystem conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources, possibly contributing to achieving the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 for 2030. © 2022 by Annual Reviews.

  abstract = {Abstract                            In coastal marine ecosystems, the depletion of dissolved oxygen can cause behavioral and distributional shifts of organisms and thereby alter ecological processes. We used the spatiotemporal variation in the onset and intensity of low dissolved oxygen in Hood Canal, Washington, USA, to investigate consequences of seasonally reduced oxygen on fish–zooplankton predator–prey interactions. By simultaneously monitoring densities of zooplankton (primarily the euphausiid;               Euphausia pacifica               ) and zooplanktivorous fish (Pacific herring,               Clupea pallasii               , and Pacific hake,               Mercluccius productus               ), and the feeding of zooplanktivorous fish, we could separate the effects of dissolved oxygen on fish–zooplankton interactions from other seasonal changes. We expected that fish predators (especially Pacific herring) would be less abundant and have lower feeding rates when oxygen levels declined below biological thresholds, and that this would result in increased zooplankton abundance in areas with lowest dissolved oxygen. However, these expectations were not borne out. Overall, there was mixed evidence for an effect of dissolved oxygen on many of our response variables, and when effects were detected, they were frequently in the opposite direction of our expectations. Specifically, the pelagic fish community became more abundant (as measured by increasing acoustic backscatter), which was particularly pronounced for Pacific herring. Zooplankton had weak evidence for a response to dissolved oxygen, but the direction was negative instead of positive. Although predator feeding composition was unrelated to dissolved oxygen, stomach fullness (an index of feeding intensity) of Pacific herring declined, as per our expectations. These unexpected findings highlight the importance of in situ measurements of multiple aspects of predator–prey linkages in response to environmental stress to enhance our ability to predict ecological consequences of declining oxygen.},

As the cause of the linear increase of subsurface phosphate and AOU, we speculated that vertical water exchange in the upper layers of the subarctic North Pacific might have been diminished during this period.

  abstract = {The metabolism and hypoxia tolerance of marine ectotherms play key roles in limiting species geographical ranges, but underlying traits have only been directly measured for a small fraction of biodiversity. Here we diagnose and analyse spatial and phylogenetic patterns in hypoxia tolerance and its temperature sensitivity at ecologically active metabolic rates, by combining a model of organismal oxygen (O2) balance with global climate and biogeographic data for approximately 25 000 animal species from 13 phyla. Large-scale spatial trait patterns reveal that active hypoxia tolerance is greater and less temperature sensitive among tropical species compared to polar ones, consistent with sparse experimental data. Species energetic demands for activity vary less with temperature than resting costs, an inference confirmed by available rate measurements. Across the tree of life, closely related species share similar hypoxia traits, indicating that evolutionary history shapes physiological tolerances to O2 and temperature. Trait frequencies are highly conserved across phyla, suggesting the breadth of global aerobic conditions selects for convergent trait diversity. Our results support aerobic limitation as a constraint on marine habitat distributions and their responses to climate change and highlight the under-sampling of aerobic traits among species living in the ocean's tropical and polar oxythermal extremes. This article is part of the theme issue ‘The evolutionary significance of variation in metabolic rates’.},

Dominant species in summer were Pseudocalanus sp., Acartia clausii, A.longiremis, Calanus marshallae, and Oithona similis. These are primarily coastal forms with northern affinities, and they were present all year. Dominant species in winter were Paracalanus parous and Ctenocalanus vanus, forms of southern affinities. They tended to disappear completely in summer. These geographic affinities are in correspondence with the source regions for surface waters that are implied by the direction of flow in the different seasons. Abundances are about one order of magnitude higher in summer than in winter. Copepod diversity is greater in winter than summer: the winter checklist contains 51 species, while the summer list contains only 38 species.},

We used cluster analysis, ordinations, and indicator species analysis (ISA) to describe temporal variations in copepod community composition. Copepod community structure during summer was distinctly different from winter. Cluster analysis showed that the transition between winter and summer communities occurred early March/April in the 1970s, late (May/June) in the late 1990s, but in (March/April) since spring 2000. Seven copepod assemblages were identified: four were found during the summer upwelling season, two during large El Nin˜ o events, and one during winter. Interannual variations in the composition of the summer assemblages was seen: most sampling dates from the summers of 1970, 1973, 2000 and 2001 clustered into one group, and dates from 1971, 1972, and 1999 clustered into a second group. The 1983 and 1998 El Nin˜ o events clustered together, but subdivided into ‘‘early El Nin˜ o’’ and ‘‘late El Nin˜ o’’ communities. The summer of 1969 corresponded with a weak El Nin˜ o event but clustered differently from both the other El Nin˜ o events and other summer clusters. Samples collected during the 1972 El Nin˜ o event clustered with ‘‘normal’’ summers. Non-metric multidimensional ordination analysis showed that two axes accounted for 87\% of the variability in community composition; Axis 1 was associated with the influence of El Nin˜ o events and seasonal downwelling, and Axis 2 was associated with upwelling-induced productivity. ISA showed Centropages abdominalis, Acartia longiremis, and Microcalanus pusillus as indicators of upwelling; Corycaeus anglicus, Calanus pacificus, and Ctenocalanus vanus as good indicators of El Nin˜ o; and Ctenocalanus vanus, Clausocalanus, and Calocalanus styliremis as good indicators of winter conditions.},

Comprehensive observational analyses of oxygen decline are challenging, given generally sparse historical data. The Newport hydrographic (NH) line off central Oregon is one of the few locations in the northeast Pacific with long oxygen records. Good quality data are available here primarily in two time blocks: 1960–71 and 1998–present. Standard sampling extends from midshelf (bottom depth of 58 m) to 157 km offshore (bottom depth of 2880 m). Shipboard measurements have been supplemented in recent years (2006–present) with data from autonomous underwater gliders. Oxygen declines significantly over this 50-yr period across the entire NH line. In addition to decrease in the vicinity of the oxygen minimum depth (\textasciitilde 800 m), oxygen decreases across a range of density surfaces σθ = 26–27 within the thermocline, in the depth range 100–550 m. A core of decreasing oxygen (0.7 ± 0.2 μmol kg−1 yr−1 or 0.016 ± 0.005 ml l−1 yr−1) is also found over the upper slope at 150–200-m depths, within the region of average northward flow associated with the poleward undercurrent. During the summer upwelling season, the largest decline is observed near bottom on the shelf: the dissolved oxygen of upwelled water, already low, is further reduced by shelf processes, leading to near-bottom hypoxia ({$<$}60 μmol kg−1) on the Oregon shelf.},

Trawl collections were made in four depth strata (5 to 10, 10 to 14, 14 to 20 and {$>$} 20 m) during normoxia and hypoxia from 26 June to 20 October 1989. Three periods with hypoxia in the bottom water (below 10 m depth) occurred in mid-July, early August and early September, each with a duration of 6 to 14 d. The demersal fish and crustaceans studied were all affected by hypoxia, and a general migration from deeper to shallower water took place during July and August. However, when oxygen conditions improved after a hypoxic event all species, exceptS. empusa, returned to the deeper areas. The degree of vertical migration was related to levels of oxygen concentration and varied for the different species.M. undulatus was the most sensitive species to low oxygen, followed byL. xanthurus andC. sapidus. T. maculatus andS. empusa were more tolerant and survived in 14 to 25\% oxygen saturation by increasing ventilation rate and, forS. empusa, by also increasing blood pigment (haemocyanin) concentration. Periodic hypoxia driven by the spring-neap tidal cycle may represent a natural phenomenon with which the fishes and crustaceans are in a delicate balance. Areas experiencing periodic short-lived hypoxia may be good nursery grounds for fisheries species, and there is no indication that the habitat value in the study area of lower York River is lessened. However, if eutrophication lengthens the time of hypoxia or brings the system closer to anoxia the system may change and become characteristically stressed. The migratory and physiological responses of these species to hypoxia are good indicators of the severity of oxygen stress and could be used as part of an early warning monitoring system for changes in environmental quality.},

  abstract = {Preserving biodiversity is a global challenge requiring data on species' distribution and abundance over large geographic and temporal scales. However, traditional methods to survey mobile species' distribution and abundance in marine environments are often inefficient, environmentally destructive, or resource-intensive. Metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) offers a new means to assess biodiversity and on much larger scales, but adoption of this approach for surveying whole animal communities in large, dynamic aquatic systems has been slowed by significant unknowns surrounding error rates of detection and relevant spatial resolution of eDNA surveys. Here, we report the results of a 2.5~km eDNA transect surveying the vertebrate fauna present along a gradation of diverse marine habitats associated with a kelp forest ecosystem. Using PCR primers that target the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene of marine fishes and mammals, we generated eDNA sequence data and compared it to simultaneous visual dive surveys. We find spatial concordance between individual species' eDNA and visual survey trends, and that eDNA is able to distinguish vertebrate community assemblages from habitats separated by as little as \textasciitilde 60~m. eDNA reliably detected vertebrates with low false-negative error rates (1/12 taxa) when compared to the surveys, and revealed cryptic species known to occupy the habitats but overlooked by visual methods. This study also presents an explicit accounting of false negatives and positives in metabarcoding data, which illustrate the influence of gene marker selection, replication, contamination, biases impacting eDNA count data and ecology of target species on eDNA detection rates in an open ecosystem.},

  abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO2 (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

Consequently, we have limited evidence to understand and interpret the physical behavior of eDNA, to improve the efficiency of sampling, nor to target components of the eDNA spectrum for taxonomic and molecular attributes. We perform the first detailed characterization of the components of a marine eDNA sample using serial filtering from an 80 to {$<$}0.22 μm particle size gradient, a tree of life metabarcoding approach using taxon-specific and universal assays, coupled with scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent confocal microscopy. We confirm that eDNA is manifest in a broad spectrum of physical states, ranging from extracellular DNA fragments to whole cells, tissue fragments, and whole organisms. The largest of these fractions of eDNA were embedded in microbial biofilms, rather than particulate. We show that the choice of filter size and types can target components of this spectrum, can affect the detectable species richness, and notably, also enrich samples for specific taxonomic groups. Our results imply that there is considerable scope to improve the efficiency of eDNA collection from aquatic environments, and its informativeness.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the seasonal and interannual variability of the planktonic communities in a densely sampled region of the northeastern Chukchi Sea as part of a multidisciplinary ecosystem study from 2008 to 2010. Observations of chlorophyll-a, inorganic macronutrients, and zooplankton (using both 150-μm and 505-μm mesh nets) were made within two 900-NM 2 grids (Klondike and Burger) at high spatial resolution three times each in 2008 and 2009, with a third grid (Statoil) sampled twice in 2010. Sea-ice conditions prior to sampling varied notably during the study: seasonal sea ice retreat was earlier and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) were warmer in 2009 than in 2008, whereas SSTs for 2010 were intermediate between the 2008 and 2009 values. Eighty taxonomic categories of zooplankton, including 11 meroplanktonic categories, were recorded, with the greatest diversity found within the copepods (25 species), followed by the cnidarians (11 species). All species are typical for the region and most are seeded from the Bering Sea. A seasonal progression of the community structure was apparent over each survey area and was likely influenced by temperature. Cold oceanographic conditions in 2008 likely slowed growth and development of the zooplankton, such that holozooplankton abundance averaged 2389 and 106 individualsm–3 and biomass averaged 10.5 and 8.3mgDWm–3 in the 150- and 505-μm nets, respectively. An early phytoplankton bloom in 2009 apparently supported a zooplankton community of greater abundance, but moderate biomass, averaging 6842 and 189 individualsm–3, and 16.3 and 7.0mgDWm–3 in the 150- and 505-μm nets, respectively. Highest zooplankton abundance and biomass values among the three years occurred in 2010: 7396 and 198 individualsm–3 and 102.9 and 33.5mgDWm–3 in the 150- and 505-μm nets, respectively. Holozooplankton biomass changes were driven by increases in large-bodied, lipid-rich copepods. The contribution of meroplankton was substantial in this shallow-water ecosystem: numerically, they contributed 28\% in 2008, 8\% in 2009 and 56\% in 2010 to the total zooplankton community and 43\%, 27\%, and 11\%, respectively, terms of biomass for the 150-μm nets. Interannual differences in ice-melt timing, water temperatures, northward transport of water masses, and nutrients and chlorophyll concentrations resulted in highly variable pelagic productivity.},

We compared population connectivity and phylogeography based on DNA sequence variation for a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene for four Pseudocalanus species with differing biogeographical ranges within these ocean regions. Genetic analyses were linked to characterization of biological and physical environmental variables for each sampled region. Haplotype diversity was higher for the temperate species (Pseudocalanus mimus and Pseudocalanus newmani) than for the Arctic species (Pseudocalanus acuspes and Pseudocalanus minutus). Genetic differentiation among populations at regional scales was observed for all species, except P. minutus. The program Migrate-N tested the likelihood of alternative models of directional gene flow between sampled populations in relation to oceanographic features. Model results estimated predominantly northward gene flow from the Gulf of Alaska to the Beaufort Sea for P. newmani. Model scenarios that allowed bidirectional gene flow between sampled populations gave the best Bayesian predictions for P. acuspes, P. mimus and P. minutus. Under current warming trends, biogeographical boundaries and barriers for Pseudocalanus species may shift, allowing habitat range expansion or contraction and resulting in altered population connectivity between Arctic and sub-Arctic populations.},

We quantified the biochemical- (mRNA transcripts of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (grp78), 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70), 90-kDa heat shock protein (hsp90), protein synthesis of HSP70) and organismal- (oxygen consumption rates) level responses to acute heat stress on two neritic copepods (Acartia tonsa and Eurytemora affinis) with special emphasis on the role of short-term acclimation. Transcripts of hsp increased with increasing acute temperature exposure and protein quantities (HSP70) were detectable for 30 h. In A. tonsa, HSP70 synthesis was also associated with handling stress. In E. affinis, heat-dependent responses were detected in hsp90, grp78 (mRNA) and HSP70 (protein) expression. Acclimation to a warmer temperature significantly decreased the heat stress response in both species. In A. tonsa, short-term acclimation to heat was not detected at the organismal level via metabolic rate. This study reveals interspecific differences in both the gene expression of stress molecules (e.g. hsp90) as well as the stress factors needed to evoke a stress response (heat vs. handling). We demonstrate that cellular stress markers can be useful measures of short-term thermal acclimation in copepods, which may remain undetected by organismal-level measures. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Possible changes in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) provide a key source of uncertainty regarding future climate change. Maps of temperature trends over the twentieth century show a conspicuous region of cooling in the northern Atlantic. Here we present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that this cooling may be due to a reduction in the AMOC over the twentieth century and particularly after 1970. Since 1990 the AMOC seems to have partly recovered. This time evolution is consistently suggested by an AMOC index based on sea surface temperatures, by the hemispheric temperature difference, by coral-based proxies and by oceanic measurements. We discuss a possible contribution of the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet to the slowdown. Using a multi-proxy temperature reconstruction for the AMOC index suggests that the AMOC weakness after 1975 is an unprecedented event in the past millennium (p {$>$} 0.99). Further melting of Greenland in the coming decades could contribute to further weakening of the AMOC.},

This bay has an artificial breakwater which creates two sub-ecosystems, an inner little bay (heavily polluted) and an outer large bay (less polluted). We set up six sampling stations in the inner bay and nine outside, along a littoral/pelagial gradient. Zooplankton hauls were taken with a 90 µm mesh plankton net (with flowmeter). The sea surface temperature, conductivity and salinity were also measured. The abundance of "O. nana" was much higher in the little bay than outside. There were also very few males in the little bay, and almost none in the large bay, in contrast to the abundant females in the sampling stations adjacent to the little bay. The sex-ratio was always in favour of females and there were more adults than copepodites. These results indicate that the ecological status of the little bay favours the development of "O. nana", and we suggest that this species may be used as a biological indicator of such perturbed systems.},

  abstract = {Far more attention has been given to the short-term lethal impacts of reduced dissolved oxygen on commercially important fish and crabs than to the long-term sublethal impacts on these same species, or on lower trophic levels. This study demonstrates that chronic, sublethal effects of hypoxia on the copepod Acartia tonsa, a critical component of many pelagic coastal food webs, can lead to significant decreases in population growth. The results of laboratory experiments conducted at 15 °C (winter) and 25 °C (summer), under conditions of normoxia (Controls), sublethal hypoxia (1.5 ml l−1) and lethal hypoxia (0.7 ml l−1) show that egg production female−1 day−1 was significantly lower at 0.7 ml l−1 compared to Controls at both temperatures, while egg production female−1 day−1 was significantly lower at 1.5 ml l−1 compared to controls in both summer experiments and in one of the two winter experiments. Survival was significantly decreased in the 0.7 ml l−1 treatment compared to Controls and the 1.5 ml l−1 treatment. Copepods developed more slowly and matured at smaller adult body sizes at both temperatures under both lethal and sublethal hypoxia compared to normoxia. Under summer temperatures, egg production was reduced by hypoxia exposure on two counts: (1) exposure to hypoxia during development resulted in smaller adults, which translated into lower egg production, and (2) egg production was still significantly lower in hypoxia treatments compared to Controls even when differences in body size were taken into account. While copepods collected in winter and exposed to winter temperatures and hypoxia also matured at smaller body sizes than copepods exposed to normoxia, egg production in winter was almost entirely attributable to this reduction in body size. These results suggest that coastal hypoxia may have a significantly greater impact in the summer months, when copepod populations are most abundant and growing at their most rapid rate of the year. With the anticipated increases in global temperatures, hypoxia may have even greater impacts on pelagic food webs.},

  abstract = {Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary (OCNMS), which was established in 1994 and covers an area of 8257 km2, is located along Washington State's remote and rugged outer coast towards the northernmost extent of the California Current System (CCS). In this region, summertime equatorward winds drive seasonal upwelling of cold, nutrient rich waters onto the continental shelf. These waters help fuel a highly diverse and productive ecosystem that includes marine mammal and seabird communities as well as commercially and culturally important fisheries. The sanctuary is located within the boundaries of the legally defined Usual and Accustomed (U\&A) fishing grounds of four Coastal Treaty Tribes, the Hoh Tribe, Makah Tribe, Quileute Tribe, and the Quinault Indian Nation, which hold treaty fishing rights and co-manage fisheries and other natural resources within the sanctuary through state, federal, and international partnerships and agreements. This data article describes shipboard hydrographic Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) and dissolved oxygen profile data that were collected within the sanctuary at fourteen locations during mooring deployment, recovery, and maintenance cruises between the months of May and October from 2005–2023.

The data were processed using Sea-Bird Scientific's SBE Data Processing application. These data are needed for improving our understanding of subsurface oceanographic conditions — including marine heat waves, changes in timing of spring transition to upwelling, seasonal hypoxia, and ocean acidification — in this important but undersampled region, and can be used to help improve the management of marine resources regionally and within the sanctuary.

  abstract = {The bottom waters of the mesohaline portion of Chesapeake Bay become depleted in oxygen in summer. We found that copepods and nauplii were in low abundance or absent from bottom waters when oxygen concentrations were {$<$}1 mg O2 liter−1. In contrast, when oxygen concentrations were higher in bottom waters in spring or summer due to episodic mixing events, the highest copepod abundances were often found in bottom waters. Laboratory experiments confirmed that oxygen concentrations {$<$}1 mg O2 liter−1 resulted in reduced survival of the copepods Acartia tonsa and Oithona colcarva and inhibited the hatching of A. tonsa eggs. The decrease in Chesapeake Bay copepods in May–June parallels the decline of oxygen in bottom waters. Our field and laboratory data suggest that this decline in copepods could result from reduced recruitment as a consequence of egg mortality in the low-oxygen bottom waters. In summer this source of mortality would be reduced because warmer water temperatures would allow the eggs to hatch in the upper water column above the low-oxygen bottom waters.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Hypoxia, triggered in large part by eutrophication, exerts widespread and expanding stress on coastal ecosystems. Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations \&lt; 2 mg L\textsuperscript{−1}. However, DO concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar DO concentrations. Living under sub-optimum DO can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low DO waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both DO and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Differences in population vulnerability to warming are defined by spatial patterns in thermal adaptation. These patterns may be driven by natural selection over spatial environmental gradients, but can also be shaped by gene flow, especially in marine taxa with high dispersal potential. Understanding and predicting organismal responses to warming requires disentangling the opposing effects of selection and gene flow. We begin by documenting genetic divergence of thermal tolerance and developmental phenotypic plasticity. Ten populations of the widespread copepod Acartia tonsa were collected from sites across a large thermal gradient, ranging from the Florida Keys to Northern New Brunswick, Canada (spanning over 20° latitude). Thermal performance curves (TPCs) from common garden experiments revealed local adaptation at the sampling range extremes, with thermal tolerance increasing at low latitudes and decreasing at high latitudes. The opposite pattern was observed in phenotypic plasticity, which was strongest at high latitudes. No relationship was observed between phenotypic plasticity and environmental variables. Instead, the results are consistent with the hypothesis of a trade-off between thermal tolerance and the strength of phenotypic plasticity. Over a large portion of the sampled range, however, we observed a remarkable lack of differentiation of TPCs. To examine whether this lack of divergence is the result of selection for a generalist performance curve or constraint by gene flow, we analyzed cytochrome oxidase I mtDNA sequences, which revealed four distinct genetic clades, abundant genetic diversity, and widely distributed haplotypes. Strong divergence in thermal performance within genetic clades, however, suggests that the pace of thermal adaptation can be relatively rapid. The combined insight from the laboratory physiological experiments and genetic data indicate that gene flow constrains differentiation of TPCs. This balance between gene flow and selection has implications for patterns of vulnerability to warming. Taking both genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity into account, our results suggest that local adaptation does not increase vulnerability to warming, and that low-latitude populations in general may be more vulnerable to predicted temperature change over the next century.},

  abstract = {Predicting the response of populations to climate change requires an understanding of how various factors affect thermal performance. Genetic differentiation is well known to affect thermal performance, but the effects of sex and developmental phenotypic plasticity often go uncharacterized. We used common garden experiments to test for effects of local adaptation, developmental phenotypic plasticity and individual sex on thermal performance of the ubiquitous copepod, Acartia tonsa (Calanoida, Crustacea) from two populations strongly differing in thermal regimes (Florida and Connecticut, USA). Females had higher thermal tolerance than males in both populations, while the Florida population had higher thermal tolerance compared with the Connecticut population. An effect of developmental phenotypic plasticity on thermal tolerance was observed only in the Connecticut population. Our results show clearly that thermal performance is affected by complex interactions of the three tested variables. Ignoring sex-specific differences in thermal performance may result in a severe underestimation of population-level impacts of warming because of population decline due to sperm limitation. Furthermore, despite having a higher thermal tolerance, low-latitude populations may be more vulnerable to warming as they lack the ability to respond to increases in temperature through phenotypic plasticity.},

  abstract = {Copepods are key components of aquatic habitats across the globe. Understanding how they respond to warming is important for predicting the effects of climate change on aquatic communities. Lethal thermal limits may play an important role in determining responses to warming. Thermal tolerance can vary over several different spatial and temporal scales, but we still lack a fundamental understanding of what drives the evolution of these patterns in copepods. In this Horizons piece, we provide a synthesis of global patterns in copepod thermal tolerance and potential acclimatory capacities. Copepod thermal tolerance increases with maximum annual temperature. We also find that the effects of phenotypic plasticity on thermal tolerance are negatively related to the magnitude of thermal tolerance, suggesting a potential trade-off between these traits. Our ability to fully describe these patterns is limited, however, by a lack of spatial, temporal and phylogenetic coverage in copepod thermal tolerance data. We indicate several priority areas for future work on copepod thermal tolerance, and accompanying suggestions regarding experimental design and methodology.},

  abstract = {The recovery of predators has the potential to restore ecosystems and fundamentally alter the services they provide. One iconic example of this is keystone predation by sea otters in the Northeast Pacific. Here, we combine spatial time series of sea otter abundance, canopy kelp area, and benthic invertebrate abundance from Washington State, USA, to examine the shifting consequences of sea otter reintroduction for kelp and kelp forest communities. We leverage the spatial variation in sea otter recovery to understand connections between sea otters and the kelp forest community. Sea otter increases created a pronounced decline in sea otter prey—particularly kelp-grazing sea urchins—and led to an expansion of canopy kelps from the late 1980s until roughly 2000. However, while sea otter and kelp population growth rates were positively correlated prior to 2002, this association disappeared over the last two decades. This disconnect occurred despite surveys showing that sea otter prey have continued to decline. Kelp area trends are decoupled from both sea otter and benthic invertebrate abundance at current densities. Variability in kelp abundance has declined in the most recent 15~years, as it has the synchrony in kelp abundance among sites. Together, these findings suggest that initial nearshore community responses to sea otter population expansion follow predictably from trophic cascade theory, but now, other factors may be as or more important in influencing community dynamics. Thus, the utility of sea otter predation in ecosystem restoration must be considered within the context of complex and shifting environmental conditions.},

Each of these stressors has wide-ranging effects on physiological systems, which may differ among species and life-history stages. Simultaneous exposure to multiple stressors may lead to even stronger impacts on organisms, but interacting effects remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how single- and multiple-stressor effects on physiology may drive changes in the behavior, biogeography, and ecosystem structure in coastal marine ecosystems, with emphasis on the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. By analyzing the effects of stressors on physiological processes common to many marine taxa, we may be able to develop broadly applicable understandings of the effects of global change. This mechanistic foundation may contribute to the development of models and other decision-support tools to assist resource managers and policymakers in anticipating and addressing global change–driven alterations in marine populations and ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The Arctic bloom consists of two distinct categories of primary producers, ice algae growing within and on the underside of the sea ice, and phytoplankton growing in open waters. Long chain omega-3 fatty acids, a subgroup of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) produced exclusively by these algae, are essential to all marine organisms for successful reproduction, growth, and development. During an extensive field study in the Arctic shelf seas, we followed the seasonal biomass development of ice algae and phytoplankton and their food quality in terms of their relative PUFA content. The first PUFA-peak occurred in late April during solid ice cover at the onset of the ice algal bloom, and the second PUFA-peak occurred in early July just after the ice break-up at the onset of the phytoplankton bloom. The reproduction and growth of the key Arctic grazer Calanus glacialis perfectly coincided with these two bloom events. Females of C. glacialis utilized the high-quality ice algal bloom to fuel early maturation and reproduction, whereas the resulting offspring had access to ample high-quality food during the phytoplankton bloom 2 months later. Reduction in sea ice thickness and coverage area will alter the current primary production regime due to earlier ice break-up and onset of the phytoplankton bloom. A potential mismatch between the two primary production peaks of high-quality food and the reproductive cycle of key Arctic grazers may have negative consequences for the entire lipid-driven Arctic marine ecosystem.},

To maximize performance of downstream quantitative PCR (qPCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) applications, quality and quantity of the starting material is crucial, calling for optimized capture, storage and extraction techniques of eDNA. Previous comparative studies for eDNA capture/storage have tested precipitation and ‘open’ filters. However, practical ‘enclosed’ filters which reduce unnecessary handling have not been included. Here, we fill this gap by comparing a filter capsule (Sterivex-GP polyethersulfone, pore size 0·22 μm, hereafter called SX) with commonly used methods. Our experimental set-up, covering altogether 41 treatments combining capture by precipitation or filtration with different preservation techniques and storage times, sampled one single lake (and a fish-free control pond). We selected documented capture methods that have successfully targeted a wide range of fauna. The eDNA was extracted using an optimized protocol modified from the DNeasy® Blood \& Tissue kit (Qiagen). We measured total eDNA concentrations and Cq-values (cycles used for DNA quantification by qPCR) to target specific mtDNA cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences in two local keystone fish species. SX yielded higher amounts of total eDNA along with lower Cq-values than polycarbonate track-etched filters (PCTE), glass fibre filters (GF) or ethanol precipitation (EP). SX also generated lower Cq-values than cellulose nitrate filters (CN) for one of the target species. DNA integrity of SX samples did not decrease significantly after 2 weeks of storage in contrast to GF and PCTE. Adding preservative before storage improved SX results. In conclusion, we recommend SX filters (originally designed for filtering micro-organisms) as an efficient capture method for sampling macrobial eDNA. Ethanol or Longmire's buffer preservation of SX immediately after filtration is recommended. Preserved SX capsules may be stored at room temperature for at least 2 weeks without significant degradation. Reduced handling and less exposure to outside stress compared with other filters may contribute to better eDNA results. SX capsules are easily transported and enable eDNA sampling in remote and harsh field conditions as samples can be filtered/preserved on site.},

Shifts in the distribution patterns of zooplankters in association with these events have been documented, but the mechanisms responsible for these shifts have not been investigated. This study assessed interspecific differences in responses to hypoxia by several species of calanoid copepods common off Turkey Point, Florida, USA: Labidocera aestiva (Wheeler) (a summer/fall species), Acartia tonsa (Dana) (a ubiquitous year-round species), and Centropages hamatus (Lilljeborg) (a winter/spring species). Under conditions of moderate to severe hypoxia 24-h survival experiments were conducted for adults and nauplii of these species from August 1994 to October 1995. Experiments on adults used a flow-through system to maintain constant d.o. concentrations. Adults of A. tonsa showed no decline in survival with d.o. as low as 1.0\,ml l−1, sharp declines in survival at d.o.\,=\,0.9 to 0.6\,ml l−1, and 100\% mortality with d.o.\,=\,0.5\,ml l−1. Adults of L. aestiva and C. hamatus were more sensitive to oxygen depletion: both species experienced significant decreases in survival for d.o.\,=\,1.0\,ml l−1. Nauplii of L. aestiva and A. tonsa showed no significant mortality with d.o.\,=\,1.1 to 1.5\,ml␣l−1 and d.o.\,=\,0.24 to 0.5\,ml l−1, respectively. In addition, experiments investigating behavioral avoidance of moderate to severe hypoxia were carried out for adults of all three species. None of the three species effectively avoided either severely hypoxic (d.o. {$<$} 0.5\,ml l−1) or moderately hypoxic (d.o. ≈\,1.0\,ml l−1) bottom layers in stratified columns. These results suggest that in␣nearshore areas where development of zones of d.o. {$<$}\,1.0\,ml l−1 may be sudden, widespread, or unpredictable, patterns of reduced copepod abundance in bottom waters may be due primarily to mortality rather than avoidance.},

Here, we first combine meta-data of experimental assessments from across the globe to investigate the potential interactive impacts of deoxygenation and acidification on a broad range of marine taxa. We then characterize the differing degrees of deoxygenation and acidification tested in our dataset using a ratio between the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide (pO2/pCO2) to assess how biological processes change under an extensive, yet diverse range of pO2 and pCO2 conditions. The dataset comprised 375 experimental comparisons and revealed predominantly additive but variable effects (91.7\%, additive; 6.0\%, synergistic; and 2.3\%, antagonistic) of the dual stressors, yielding negative impacts across almost all responses examined. Our data indicate that the pO2/pCO2-ratio offers a simplified metric to characterize the extremity of the concurrent stressors and shows that more severe impacts occurred when ratios represented more extreme deoxygenation and acidification conditions. Importantly, our analysis highlights the need to assess the concurrent impacts of deoxygenation and acidification on marine taxa and that assessments considering the impact of O2 depletion alone will likely underestimate the impacts of deoxygenation events and their ecosystem-wide consequences.},

  abstract = {The Acartia tonsa, a calanoid copepod species, has high survival and thermal acclimation capacity in aquatic environments characterized by temperature variations. Dynamic and static thermal polygon areas of this species are 495 °C2 and 267 °C2 for nauplii stage, while adult stage has 747 °C2 and 411 °C2 dynamic and static thermal polygon area, respectively. In addition, Acartia tonsa is a copepod species which is more resistant to both high and low lethal temperatures, with its resistance zone of 105 °C2 and 131 °C2 for nauplii and adults, respectively. Acartia tonsa nauplii acclimated to 18~°C, 23~°C and 28~°C have lover and upper thermal limit (CTMin-CTMax) of 6.82–26.15~°C, 8.65–29.49~°C, and 11.70–34.10~°C, respectively. This species in the adult stage has a CTMin-CTMax of 4.47–30.30~°C, 6.35–33.94~°C, and 9.92–35.90~°C at acclimation temperatures mentioned above. Its broad dynamic and static thermal tolerance polygon areas and, accordingly, its significant thermal limits allow Acartia tonsa to survive at warm or cold extremes in their natural environment.},

  abstract = {Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) is a schooling planktivorous fish consumed by numerous fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This paper aimed to determine whether Pacific herring serves as a key forage fish (i.e. strongly supports predator populations) in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska. All analyses were conducted using mass- and energy-balanced ecosystem models constructed in Ecopath with Ecosim. Supportive Role to Fishery (SURF) index values were computed using predator diets and food web structure encoded in static ecosystem models. Ecosystem impacts of herring stock depletion and collapse were evaluated using quantitative criteria (thresholds) applied to dynamic ecosystem simulations. SURF index values from mass-balanced models lay below the threshold required to designate herring as a key forage fish. However, values from an energy-balanced model supported the key status of herring. Dynamic ecosystem simulations in mass- and energy-balanced models revealed strong negative effects of herring depletion on several predators. In most energy-balanced models, simulation results designated herring as a key forage fish despite indications of functional redundancy in the forage fish guild. Impacts of herring depletion on predators were stronger and more numerous in energy-balanced models, suggesting that the high energy content of herring enhances its importance to predators. Simulation results also demonstrated positive impacts of herring depletion on two zooplankton groups due to release from predation pressure. The status of Pacific herring as a key forage fish apparently depends on its energy content relative to other forage fish. Nevertheless, the results of this study support precautionary, ecosystem-based management of Pacific herring fisheries.},

  abstract = {Chapter “Introduction to environmental DNA (eDNA)” defines the central concepts of this book. Environmental DNA (eDNA) corresponds to a mixture of genomic DNA from many different organisms found in an environmental sample such as water, soil, or feces. DNA metabarcoding can be defined as the simultaneous DNA-based identification of many taxa found in the same eDNA extract. It is usually based on the analysis of a metabarcode (i.e., a short and taxonomically informative DNA region). Metagenomics refers to the assembly and functional analysis of the different genomes found in an environmental sample, while metatranscriptomics examines gene expression and regulation at the sampling time based on the set of RNAs extracted from such a sample. Chapter also presents a brief history of eDNA, highlights the different steps of an eDNA study, and gives an overview of the different eDNA methods implemented in ecological research or biodiversity management.},

  abstract = {The classical dichotomy poses strict autotrophic (phytoplankton) and heterotrophic (zooplankton) protists as the only “engines” at the base of marine food webs. This paradigm has been challenged by the existence of unicellular mixoplankton, able to photosynthesize and predate simultaneously. Due to only recently appraisal, our knowledge on the role of mixoplankton in food webs is still very limited. By laboratory and in silico approaches, this Thesis addressed the effect of protistan mixotrophy on copepods, ubiquitous crustacean zooplankton that act as consumers of protists and as prey for larger predators. The ecophysiological response of the calanoid copepod Paracartia grani to several autotrophic, mixotrophic and heterotrophic diets was examined. In most cases no substantial differences in the copepod vital rates emerged on the basis of the nutrition type, as differences were mainly due to species-specific traits of the prey. Nevertheless, when feeding on the dinoflagellate Karlodinium veneficum grown under contrasting trophic modes (auto- vs mixotrophic), copepod egestion rate and gross-growth efficiency varied significantly. This indicates that mixotrophy in certain protists has the potential to influence nutrient transfer, export and recruitment of next copepod generation. As interesting results had emerged from the species K. veneficum, this dinoflagellate was tested as prey for the calanoid copepods P. grani and Centropages typicus with the aim to investigate the effect of inorganic nutrient limitation (N and P) on the food quality of K. veneficum and to ascertain how these abiotic conditions might influence copepod ecophysiological response. Results show that nutrient-limited mixotrophic K. veneficum had more stable stoichiometric ratios in comparison to autotrophs. Both copepod species ingested and reproduced more when fed nutrient-depleted mixotrophic K. veneficum compared to autotrophic counterparts. In the light of this, it can be concluded that this mixoplankter can buffer inorganic nutrient shortage by feeding on a prey, increasing the nutrient transfer to copepods contrarily to autotrophs. Through in-silico experiments, the effect of future environmental changes on the dynamics of a food web was simulated. The model encompassed three plankton functional types (phyto-, mixo- and zooplankton) and three trophic strategies (auto-, mixo- and heterotrophy). Blooms of K. veneficum were simulated under autotrophic and mixotrophic strategies (feeding on cryptophytes) and copepods of the species P. grani were allowed to feed on both protists. The dinoflagellate growth was enhanced when supplied with phagotrophy, promoting more nutritious and abundant food landscape for copepods. Bottom-up restrictions such as low inorganic nutrients and low cryptophytes availability decreased K. veneficum biomass with consequent limitation of zooplankton production. Copepods improved protist food quality via nutrient regeneration, but young and high-biomass populations attenuated the dinoflagellate bloom. The trophic transfer efficiency from prey to predators increased in presence of mixotrophy, especially in oligotrophic condition. By virtue of expected changes in the abiotic and biotic landscape, these simulations pinpoint the need of addressing the mixoplankton-copepod link when describing foodweb dynamics.},

The change in dissolved oxygen resulting from the biological processes has been evaluated by the change in phosphate. The observations during the period from 1973 to 1980 show a marked seasonal variation in the exchange constants. The mean thickness of the surface film or the molecular diffusion layer at the interface calculated from the exchange constants is 12μm in winter, whereas that is 45μm in summer. Both values are greater than those obtained from laboratory experiments and the field observations of radon profiles, but nearly equal to the value calculated from the mean residence time of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The seasonal variation is due to the roughness of the sea surface, suggesting that the exchange constant seems to be proportional to the square or the cube of wind velocity. The Bay is a source of oxygen to the atmosphere, where the net production of oxygen is found to be 1701/m2/yr.},

Bio-control of vectors by copepods is an ideal method of using interactions in the natural ecosystem for vector management, with minimum consequences on the environment. Current study determined the predatory efficacy of five locally abundant copepod species on, Aedes larvae under laboratory conditions. Copepods were collected from the pre-identified locations within the districts of Gampaha and Kandy, and identified morphologically. Individual species of copepods were maintained as separate colonies with Paramecium culture and wheat grain as supplementary food. Five adult copepods of each species was introduced into separate containers with 200 larvae (1st instar) of Aedes aegypti. Number of larvae survived in containers were enumerated at 3 hour intervals within a duration of 24 hours. Each experiment was repeated five times. The same procedure was followed for Ae. albopictus. Significance in the variations among predation rates was evaluated with General Linear Modelling (GLM) followed by Tukey’s pair-wise comparison in SPSS (version 23). Significant variations in predation rates of studied copepod species were reported (p{$<$}0.05), whereby M. leuckarti indicated the highest followed by M. scrassus, while C. languides indicated the lowest predatory efficacy. The effect of different Aedes larval species on the predation rates of copepods remained significant (p{$<$}0.05), even though the effect on predatory efficiency was not significant. Based on the findings, both M. leuckarti and M. scrassus, with the highest predatory efficiencies, could be recommended as potential candidates for biological controlling of Aedes vectors in Sri Lanka.},

The meta-analysis confirmed that survival times under hypoxia were reduced by on average 74\% and that median lethal concentration increased by on average 16\% when marine benthic organisms were exposed to warmer temperatures. Warming reduced survival times of marine benthic macrofauna under hypoxia by a median of 3.95±1.67 h °C−1 and increased the oxygen thresholds for hypoxia-driven mortality by a median of 1.02±0.15\% saturation °C−1 or 0.07±0.01 mg O2 L−1 °C−1. The corresponding Q10 values averaged 3.01±0.29 for the median survival time and 2.09±0.20 for the median lethal oxygen concentration. Use of these Q10 values predicts that the 4 °C warming expected during the 21st century will lead to survival times 35.6\% lower under hypoxia and that the threshold oxygen concentrations for high mortality to occur will increase by, on average, 25.5\% if bottom water temperature increased by 4 °C.

Zooplankton were collected biweekly in vertical net tows from three regions of Puget Sound and one in northern Washington waters near the Strait of Juan de Fuca, from 2014 to 2020. Water temperatures were cooler in the north and warmer in the south, with anomalously high temperatures occurring in 2015–2016 in all regions. Chlorophyll biomass showed no consistent relationship with temperature. All regions had anomalously high zooplankton biomass in 2015, which continued in the three Puget Sound regions through 2017, with the two central stations showing the most dramatic increases. Several large crustacean species and molluscs showed positive biomass anomalies during the MHW. Euphausiid furcilia showed differential response by species. Puget Sound resident copepod species showed primarily positive anomalies, while some boreal and subarctic copepod species were anomalously low during this period. Gelatinous zooplankton had somewhat higher biomass through the first few years of the study, but patterns showed no clear relationship with the MHW. Differing zooplankton patterns compared to those observed in the California Current, as well as prolonged effects on zooplankton biomass in Puget Sound, suggest that local forcing played a dominant role, likely differing from the mechanisms affecting zooplankton in the California Current. Primary postulated factors include increased growth and metabolism due to higher temperatures, nutrient-driven increases in primary production, and changes in species composition advected from the ocean. Further research is needed to determine the ramifications of the changes and how they may affect the food web in the future.},

  abstract = {Long-lasting embryonic dormancy in invertebrates defies our understanding of what constitutes life because, for example, eggs of some copepods can delay hatching for decades or even centuries. Copepods, often millimeter-sized crustaceans, are some of the most numerous multicellular organisms on earth and are key organisms in most aquatic food webs. Some important free-living marine and estuarine species overwinter or oversummer by arrested embryogenesis in dormancy. The present contribution discusses the complex mechanisms behind embryonic dormancy by compiling knowledge from the 42 calanoid copepods from the superfamily Centropagoidea with well-described embryonic dormancy, which has been of scientific interest for decades. However, the determination of categories of copepod resting eggs-that is, diapause and quiescence, transitions between categories, the mechanisms controlling arrested development by the embryos, and how they interact with their surroundings-is not fully understood. Moreover, a clear link between the presence of the free-swimming population and their resting eggs in sediments is still not convincingly demonstrated. Here I evaluate the relative significance of potential cues driving the production of and the phase shift between egg categories. Understanding the initiation and termination of embryonic dormancy is of great importance for fundamental science-that is, population and food web ecology as well as climate science, aquaculture live feed, and ballast water research. Molecular techniques are developing rapidly, especially within health sciences, thus providing relevant tools applicable for plankton research. Here I suggest that applying molecular methods in addition to traditional physiological approaches in future research will lead to greater understanding of copepod embryonic dormancy, one of nature's wonders.},

  abstract = {Increasing deoxygenation (loss of oxygen) of the ocean, including expansion of oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), is a potentially important consequence of global warming. We examined present-day variability of vertical distributions of 23 calanoid copepod species in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) living in locations with different water column oxygen profiles and OMZ intensity (lowest oxygen concentration and its vertical extent in a profile). Copepods and hydrographic data were collected in vertically stratified day and night MOCNESS (Multiple Opening/Closing Net and Environmental Sensing System) tows (0–1000\&thinsp;m) during four cruises over a decade (2007–2017) that sampled four ETNP locations: Costa Rica Dome, Tehuantepec Bowl, and two oceanic sites further north (21–22∘\&thinsp;N) off Mexico. The sites had different vertical oxygen profiles: some with a shallow mixed layer, abrupt thermocline, and extensive very low oxygen OMZ core; and others with a more gradual vertical development of the OMZ (broad mixed layer and upper oxycline zone) and a less extensive OMZ core where oxygen was not as low. Calanoid copepod species (including examples from the genera Eucalanus, Pleuromamma, and Lucicutia) demonstrated different distributional strategies (implying different physiological characteristics) associated with this variability. We identified sets of species that (1) changed their vertical distributions and depth of maximum abundance associated with the depth and intensity of the OMZ and its oxycline inflection points; (2) shifted their depth of diapause; (3) adjusted their diel vertical migration, especially the nighttime upper depth; or (4) expanded or contracted their depth range within the mixed layer and upper part of the thermocline in association with the thickness of the aerobic epipelagic zone (habitat compression concept). These distribution depths changed by tens to hundreds of meters depending on the species, oxygen profile, and phenomenon. For example, at the lower oxycline, the depth of maximum abundance for Lucicutia hulsemannae shifted from ∼600 to ∼800\&thinsp;m, and the depth of diapause for Eucalanus inermis shifted from ∼500 to ∼775\&thinsp;m, in an expanded OMZ compared to a thinner OMZ, but remained at similar low oxygen levels in both situations. These species or life stages are examples of “hypoxiphilic” taxa. For the migrating copepod Pleuromamma abdominalis, its nighttime depth was shallow (∼20\&thinsp;m) when the aerobic mixed layer was thin and the low-oxygen OMZ broad, but it was much deeper (∼100\&thinsp;m) when the mixed layer and higher oxygen extended deeper; daytime depth in both situations was ∼300\&thinsp;m. Because temperature decreased with depth, these distributional depth shifts had metabolic implications.  The upper ocean to mesopelagic depth range encompasses a complex interwoven ecosystem characterized by intricate relationships among its inhabitants and their environment. It is a critically important zone for oceanic biogeochemical and export processes and hosts key food web components for commercial fisheries. Among the zooplankton, there will likely be winners and losers with increasing ocean deoxygenation as species cope with environmental change. Changes in individual copepod species abundances, vertical distributions, and life history strategies may create potential perturbations to these intricate food webs and processes. Present-day variability provides a window into future scenarios and potential effects of deoxygenation.},

  abstract = {Copepods, which play major roles in marine food webs and biogeochemical cycling, frequently undergo diel vertical migration (DVM), swimming downwards during the day to avoid visual predation and upwards at night to feed. Natural water columns that are stratified with chemical stressors at depth, such as hypoxia and acidification, are increasing with climate change. Understanding behavioral responses of copepods to these stresses — in particular, whether copepods alter their natural migration — is important to anticipating impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. We conducted laboratory experiments using stratified water columns to measure the effects of bottom water hypoxia and pH on mortality, distribution, and swimming behaviors of the calanoid copepod Calanus pacificus. When exposed to hypoxic (0.65 mg O2 l−1) bottom waters, the height of C. pacificus from the bottom increased 20\% within hypoxic columns, and swimming speed decreased 46\% at the bottom of hypoxic columns and increased 12\% above hypoxic waters. When exposed to low pH (7.48) bottom waters, swimming speeds decreased by 8 and 9\% at the base of the tanks and above acidic waters, respectively. Additionally, we found a 118\% increase in ‘moribund’ (immobile on the bottom) copepods when exposed to hypoxic, but not acidic, bottom waters. Some swimming statistics differed between copepods collected from sites with versus without historical hypoxia and acidity. Observed responses suggest potential mechanisms underlying in situ changes in copepod population distributions when exposed to chemical stressors at depth. © The authors 2022.},

However, the method has hitherto lacked field tests that evaluate its effectiveness and practical properties as a biodiversity monitoring tool. Here, we evaluated the ability of eDNA metabarcoding to reveal fish community structures in species-rich coastal waters. High-performance fish-universal primers and systematic spatial water sampling at 47 stations covering \textasciitilde 11\,km2 revealed the fish community structure at a species resolution. The eDNA metabarcoding based on a 6-h collection of water samples detected 128 fish species, of which 62.5\% (40 species) were also observed by underwater visual censuses conducted over a 14-year period. This method also detected other local fishes (≥23 species) that were not observed by the visual censuses. These eDNA metabarcoding features will enhance marine ecosystem-related research, and the method will potentially become a standard tool for surveying fish communities.},

Walleye pollock depended exclusively ({$>$}99\%) on pelagic prey and showed a clear ontogenetic dietary shift: smaller fish depended mainly upon mesozooplankton such as Neocalanus cristatus and Euphausia pacifica, and larger fish preyed upon pollock (cannibalism), myctophids Diaphus theta and firefly squid Watasenia scintillans. Seasonal variation was also evident. Smaller pollock depended mainly upon N. cristatus during spring then shifted gradually to E. pacifica during other seasons. For larger pollock, major prey shifted from pollock (cannibalism) during spring to micronekton during other seasons. Bathymetric variation was less pronounced, with cannibalism and Themisto spp. being more important in the shallow area (¾150 m). Feeding intensity, measured as stomach content index, was generally higher during spring and summer than autumn and winter, but showed incidentally high values during winter, suggesting sporadic but intense feeding opportunities. Fish condition fell during winter and then recovered rapidly during May and June. Recovery coincided with superabundance of N. cristatus during blooming, so that this species is essential for the recovery of pollock from wintering and spawning.},
