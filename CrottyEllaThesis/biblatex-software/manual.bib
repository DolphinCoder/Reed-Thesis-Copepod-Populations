  abstract={Software is a fundamental pillar of modern scientific research, across all fields and disciplines. However, there is a lack of adequate means to cite and reference software due to the complexity of the problem in terms of authorship, roles, and credits. This complexity is further increased when it is considered over the lifetime of a software that can span up to several decades. Building upon the internal experience of Inria, the French research institute for digital sciences, we provide in this article a contribution to the ongoing efforts in order to develop proper guidelines and recommendations for software citation and reference. Namely, we recommend: first, a richer taxonomy for software contributions with a qualitative scale; second, to put humans at the heart of the evaluation; and third, to distinguish citation from reference.},

  Title		= {Referencing Source Code Artifacts: a Separate Concern in Software Citation},
  Abstract	= {Among the entities involved in software citation, software
		  source code requires special attention, due to the role it
		  plays in ensuring scientific reproducibility. To reference
		  source code we need identifiers that are not only unique
		  and persistent, but also support integrity checking
		  intrinsically. Suitable iden- tifiers must guarantee that
		  denoted objects will always stay the same, without relying
		  on external third parties and administrative processes. We
		  analyze the role of identifiers for digital objects (IDOs),
		  whose properties are different from, and complementary to,
		  those of the various digital identifiers of objects (DIOs)
		  that are today popular building blocks of software and data
		  citation toolchains. We argue that both kinds of
		  identifiers are needed and detail the syntax, semantics,
		  and practical implementation of the persistent identifiers
		  (PIDs) adopted by the Software Heritage project to
		  reference billions of software source code artifacts such
		  as source code files, directories, and commits.},
