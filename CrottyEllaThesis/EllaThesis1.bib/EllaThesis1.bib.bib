	abstract = {The 2021 summer upwelling season off the United States Pacific Northwest coast was unusually strong leading to widespread near-bottom, low-oxygen waters. During summer 2021, an unprecedented number of ship- and underwater glider-based measurements of dissolved oxygen were made in this region. Near-bottom hypoxia, that is dissolved oxygen less than 61 µmol kg−1 and harmful to marine animals, was observed over nearly half of the continental shelf inshore of the 200-m isobath, covering 15,500 square kilometers. A mid-shelf ribbon with near-bottom, dissolved oxygen less than 50 µmol kg−1 extended for 450 km off north-central Oregon and Washington. Spatial patterns in near-bottom oxygen are related to the continental shelf width and other features of the region. Maps of near-bottom oxygen since 1950 show a consistent trend toward lower oxygen levels over time. The fraction of near-bottom water inshore of the 200-m isobath that is hypoxic on average during the summer upwelling season increases over time from nearly absent (2\%) in 1950–1980, to 24\% in 2009–2018, compared with 56\% during the anomalously strong upwelling conditions in 2021. Widespread and increasing near-bottom hypoxia is consistent with increased upwelling-favorable wind forcing under climate change.},

	abstract = {Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary ({OCNMS}), which was established in 1994 and covers an area of 8257 km2, is located along Washington State's remote and rugged outer coast towards the northernmost extent of the California Current System ({CCS}). In this region, summertime equatorward winds drive seasonal upwelling of cold, nutrient rich waters onto the continental shelf. These waters help fuel a highly diverse and productive ecosystem that includes marine mammal and seabird communities as well as commercially and culturally important fisheries. The sanctuary is located within the boundaries of the legally defined Usual and Accustomed (U\&A) fishing grounds of four Coastal Treaty Tribes, the Hoh Tribe, Makah Tribe, Quileute Tribe, and the Quinault Indian Nation, which hold treaty fishing rights and co-manage fisheries and other natural resources within the sanctuary through state, federal, and international partnerships and agreements. This data article describes shipboard hydrographic Conductivity-Temperature-Depth ({CTD}) and dissolved oxygen profile data that were collected within the sanctuary at fourteen locations during mooring deployment, recovery, and maintenance cruises between the months of May and October from 2005–2023. The 792 {CTD} profiles were acquired using Sea-Bird Scientific 19 {SeaCAT} or 19plus {SeaCAT} {CTD} profilers with associated {SBE}-43 (Sea-Bird Electronics) or Beckman or {YSI}-type (Yellow Springs Instruments) dissolved oxygen sensors. The data were processed using Sea-Bird Scientific's {SBE} Data Processing application. These data are needed for improving our understanding of subsurface oceanographic conditions — including marine heat waves, changes in timing of spring transition to upwelling, seasonal hypoxia, and ocean acidification — in this important but undersampled region, and can be used to help improve the management of marine resources regionally and within the sanctuary.

	abstract = {The recovery of predators has the potential to restore ecosystems and fundamentally alter the services they provide. One iconic example of this is keystone predation by sea otters in the Northeast Pacific. Here, we combine spatial time series of sea otter abundance, canopy kelp area, and benthic invertebrate abundance from Washington State, {USA}, to examine the shifting consequences of sea otter reintroduction for kelp and kelp forest communities. We leverage the spatial variation in sea otter recovery to understand connections between sea otters and the kelp forest community. Sea otter increases created a pronounced decline in sea otter prey—particularly kelp-grazing sea urchins—and led to an expansion of canopy kelps from the late 1980s until roughly 2000. However, while sea otter and kelp population growth rates were positively correlated prior to 2002, this association disappeared over the last two decades. This disconnect occurred despite surveys showing that sea otter prey have continued to decline. Kelp area trends are decoupled from both sea otter and benthic invertebrate abundance at current densities. Variability in kelp abundance has declined in the most recent 15 years, as it has the synchrony in kelp abundance among sites. Together, these findings suggest that initial nearshore community responses to sea otter population expansion follow predictably from trophic cascade theory, but now, other factors may be as or more important in influencing community dynamics. Thus, the utility of sea otter predation in ecosystem restoration must be considered within the context of complex and shifting environmental conditions.},

Each of these stressors has wide-ranging effects on physiological systems, which may differ among species and life-history stages. Simultaneous exposure to multiple stressors may lead to even stronger impacts on organisms, but interacting effects remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how single- and multiple-stressor effects on physiology may drive changes in the behavior, biogeography, and ecosystem structure in coastal marine ecosystems, with emphasis on the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem. By analyzing the effects of stressors on physiological processes common to many marine taxa, we may be able to develop broadly applicable understandings of the effects of global change. This mechanistic foundation may contribute to the development of models and other decision-support tools to assist resource managers and policymakers in anticipating and addressing global change–driven alterations in marine populations and ecosystems.},

Here, we compiled data sets from a set of cruises conducted in estuarine waters of Puget Sound (southern Salish Sea) and its boundary waters (Strait of Juan de Fuca and Washington coast). This data product provides data from a decade of cruises with consistent formatting, extended data quality control, and multiple units for parameters such as oxygen with different end use needs and conventions. All cruises obtained high-quality temperature, salinity, inorganic carbon, nutrient, and oxygen observations to provide insight into the dynamic distribution of physical and biogeochemical conditions in this large urban estuary complex on the west coast of North America. At all sampling stations, conductivity–temperature–depth ({CTD}) casts included sensors for measuring temperature, conductivity, pressure, and oxygen concentrations. Laboratory analyses of discrete water samples collected at all stations throughout the water column in Niskin bottles provided measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), dissolved oxygen, nutrient (nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, and silicate), and total alkalinity ({TA}) content. This data product includes observations from 35 research cruises, including 715 oceanographic profiles, with \&gt;7490 sensor measurements of temperature, salinity, and oxygen; ≥6070 measurements of discrete oxygen and nutrient samples; and ≥4462 measurements of inorganic carbon variables (i.e., {DIC} and {TA}). The observations comprising this cruise compilation collectively characterize the spatial and temporal variability in a region with large dynamic ranges of the physical (temperature = 6.0–21.8 ∘C, salinity = 15.6–34.0) and biogeochemical (oxygen = 12–481 µmol kg−1, dissolved inorganic carbon = 1074–2362 µmol kg−1, total alkalinity = 1274–2296 µmol kg−1) parameters central to understanding ocean acidification and hypoxia in this productive estuary system with numerous interacting human impacts on its ecosystems. All observations conform to the climate-quality observing guidelines of the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, the {US} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Ocean Acidification Program, and ocean carbon community best practices. This ongoing cruise time series supports the estuarine and coastal monitoring and research objectives of the Washington Ocean Acidification Center and {US} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ({NOAA}) Ocean and Atmospheric Research programs, and it provides diverse end users with the information needed to frame biological impacts research, validate numerical models, inform state and tribal water quality and fisheries management, and support decision-makers.

	abstract = {Early life stages of salmonids are particularly vulnerable to warming and hypoxia, which are common stressors in hyporheic, gravel bed, rearing habitat (i.e. a ‘redd’). With the progression of global climate change, high temperatures and hypoxia may co-occur more frequently within redds, particularly for salmonid species at their southern range limit. Warming and hypoxia have competing effects on energy supply and demand, which can be detrimental to energy-limited early life stages. We examined how elevated temperature and hypoxia as individual and combined stressors affected the survival, physiological performance, growth, and development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We reared late fall-run Chinook salmon from fertilization to the fry stage in a fully factorial design of two temperatures [10°C (ambient) and 14°C (warm)] and two oxygen levels [normoxia (100\% air saturation, 10 mg O2/l) and hypoxia (50\% saturation, 5.5 mg O2/l)]. Rearing in hypoxia significantly reduced hatching success, especially in combination with warming. Both warming and hypoxia improved acute thermal tolerance. While rearing in hypoxia improved tolerance to acute hypoxia stress, warming reduced hypoxia tolerance. Hypoxia-reared fish were smaller at hatch, but were able to reach similar sizes to the normoxia-reared fish by the fry stage. High temperature and normoxia resulted in the fastest rate of development while low temperature and hypoxia resulted in the slowest rate of development. Despite improved physiological tolerance to acute heat and hypoxia stress, hypoxia-reared embryos had reduced survival and growth, which could have larger population-level effects. These results suggest that both warming and hypoxia are important factors to address in conservation strategies for Chinook salmon.},

              In coastal marine ecosystems, the depletion of dissolved oxygen can cause behavioral and distributional shifts of organisms and thereby alter ecological processes. We used the spatiotemporal variation in the onset and intensity of low dissolved oxygen in Hood Canal, Washington, {USA}, to investigate consequences of seasonally reduced oxygen on fish–zooplankton predator–prey interactions. By simultaneously monitoring densities of zooplankton (primarily the euphausiid;
              Euphausia pacifica
              ) and zooplanktivorous fish (Pacific herring,
              Clupea pallasii
              , and Pacific hake,
              Mercluccius productus
              ), and the feeding of zooplanktivorous fish, we could separate the effects of dissolved oxygen on fish–zooplankton interactions from other seasonal changes. We expected that fish predators (especially Pacific herring) would be less abundant and have lower feeding rates when oxygen levels declined below biological thresholds, and that this would result in increased zooplankton abundance in areas with lowest dissolved oxygen. However, these expectations were not borne out. Overall, there was mixed evidence for an effect of dissolved oxygen on many of our response variables, and when effects were detected, they were frequently in the opposite direction of our expectations. Specifically, the pelagic fish community became more abundant (as measured by increasing acoustic backscatter), which was particularly pronounced for Pacific herring. Zooplankton had weak evidence for a response to dissolved oxygen, but the direction was negative instead of positive. Although predator feeding composition was unrelated to dissolved oxygen, stomach fullness (an index of feeding intensity) of Pacific herring declined, as per our expectations. These unexpected findings highlight the importance of in situ measurements of multiple aspects of predator–prey linkages in response to environmental stress to enhance our ability to predict ecological consequences of declining oxygen.},

The corresponding Q10 values averaged 3.01±0.29 for the median survival time and 2.09±0.20 for the median lethal oxygen concentration. Use of these Q10 values predicts that the 4 °C warming expected during the 21st century will lead to survival times 35.6\% lower under hypoxia and that the threshold oxygen concentrations for high mortality to occur will increase by, on average, 25.5\% if bottom water temperature increased by 4 °C. Hence, ocean warming is expected to increase the vulnerability of benthic macrofauna to reduced oxygen concentrations and expand the area of coastal ecosystems affected by hypoxia.},

	abstract = {The metabolism and hypoxia tolerance of marine ectotherms play key roles in limiting species geographical ranges, but underlying traits have only been directly measured for a small fraction of biodiversity. Here we diagnose and analyse spatial and phylogenetic patterns in hypoxia tolerance and its temperature sensitivity at ecologically active metabolic rates, by combining a model of organismal oxygen (O2) balance with global climate and biogeographic data for approximately 25 000 animal species from 13 phyla. Large-scale spatial trait patterns reveal that active hypoxia tolerance is greater and less temperature sensitive among tropical species compared to polar ones, consistent with sparse experimental data. Species energetic demands for activity vary less with temperature than resting costs, an inference confirmed by available rate measurements. Across the tree of life, closely related species share similar hypoxia traits, indicating that evolutionary history shapes physiological tolerances to O2 and temperature. Trait frequencies are highly conserved across phyla, suggesting the breadth of global aerobic conditions selects for convergent trait diversity. Our results support aerobic limitation as a constraint on marine habitat distributions and their responses to climate change and highlight the under-sampling of aerobic traits among species living in the ocean's tropical and polar oxythermal extremes.

	abstract = {Several hypotheses of how zooplankton communities respond to coastal hypoxia have been put forward in the literature over the past few decades. We explored three of those that are focused on how zooplankton composition or biomass is affected by seasonal hypoxia using data collected over two summers in Hood Canal, a seasonally-hypoxic sub-basin of Puget Sound, Washington. We conducted hydrographic profiles and zooplankton net tows at four stations, from a region in the south that annually experiences moderate hypoxia to a region in the north where oxygen remains above hypoxic levels. The specific hypotheses tested were that low oxygen leads to: (1) increased dominance of gelatinous relative to crustacean zooplankton, (2) increased dominance of cyclopoid copepods relative to calanoid copepods, and (3) overall decreased zooplankton abundance and biomass at hypoxic sites compared to where oxygen levels are high. Additionally, we examined whether the temporal stability of community structure was decreased by hypoxia. We found evidence of a shift toward more gelatinous zooplankton and lower total zooplankton abundance and biomass at hypoxic sites, but no clear increase in the dominance of cyclopoid relative to calanoid copepods. We also found the lowest variance in community structure at the most hypoxic site, in contrast to our prediction. Hypoxia can fundamentally alter marine ecosystems, but the impacts differ among systems.},

We compared population connectivity and phylogeography based on {DNA} sequence variation for a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene for four Pseudocalanus species with differing biogeographical ranges within these ocean regions. Genetic analyses were linked to characterization of biological and physical environmental variables for each sampled region. Haplotype diversity was higher for the temperate species (Pseudocalanus mimus and Pseudocalanus newmani) than for the Arctic species (Pseudocalanus acuspes and Pseudocalanus minutus). Genetic differentiation among populations at regional scales was observed for all species, except P. minutus. The program Migrate-N tested the likelihood of alternative models of directional gene flow between sampled populations in relation to oceanographic features. Model results estimated predominantly northward gene flow from the Gulf of Alaska to the Beaufort Sea for P. newmani. Model scenarios that allowed bidirectional gene flow between sampled populations gave the best Bayesian predictions for P. acuspes, P. mimus and P. minutus. Under current warming trends, biogeographical boundaries and barriers for Pseudocalanus species may shift, allowing habitat range expansion or contraction and resulting in altered population connectivity between Arctic and sub-Arctic populations.},

Copepods, especially the naupliar stages, are important pelagic food web components, yet only a few studies have considered the effect of reduced {DO} concentrations on their survival and population dynamics. This study considers the impact of both lethal and sublethal {DO} concentrations on copepods. Acartia tonsa were reared at 25 °C at saturating {DO} (normoxic control) and reduced (hypoxic) {DO} concentrations of 1.5 or 0.7 ml l−1. Oxygen concentrations were maintained in replicate flasks, by bubbling seawater with air (control), or mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen. Egg production, but not survival, was significantly higher in the controls compared to the 1.5 ml l−1 {DO} treatment. Survival and egg production were significantly lower at 0.7 ml l−1 {DO} compared to the control. The results suggest that the sublethal as well as the lethal effects of hypoxia may have important repercussions on population and community dynamics in coastal systems.},

	abstract = {There is strong correlative evidence that variation in the growth and survival of secondary consumers is related to the copepod species composition within the Northern California Current. Potential mechanisms driving these correlations include: (1) enhanced growth and survival of secondary consumers when lipid-rich, boreal copepod species are abundant, with cascading effects on higher trophic levels; (2) the regulation of growth and condition of primary and secondary consumers by the relative proportion of certain essential fatty acids ({FAs}) in primary producers; or (3) a combination of these factors. Disentangling the relative importance of taxonomic composition, lipid quantity, and {FA} composition on the nutritional quality of copepods requires detailed information on both the consumer and primary producers. Therefore, we collected phytoplankton and copepods at an oceanographic station for 19months and completed species community analyses and generated detailed lipid profiles, including lipid classes and {FAs}, for both groups. There was strong covariation between species and biochemistry within and across trophic levels and distinct seasonal differences. The amount of total lipid within both the phytoplankton and copepod communities was twice as high in spring and summer than in fall and winter, and certain {FAs}, such as diatom indicators 20:5ω3 and 16:1ω7, comprised a greater proportion of the {FA} pool in spring and summer. Indicators of bacterial production within the copepod community were proportionally twice as high during fall and winter than spring and summer. Seasonal transitions in copepod {FA} composition were consistently offset from transitions in copepod species composition by approximately two weeks. The timing of the seasonal transition in copepod {FAs} reflected seasonal shifts in the species composition and/or biochemistry of primary producers more than seasonal shifts in the copepod species composition. These results emphasize the importance of interactions between the copepod community and their available phytoplankton prey in regulating the nutritional quality of primary consumers.},

We used cluster analysis, ordinations, and indicator species analysis ({ISA}) to describe temporal variations in copepod community composition. Copepod community structure during summer was distinctly different from winter. Cluster analysis showed that the transition between winter and summer communities occurred early March/April in the 1970s, late (May/June) in the late 1990s, but in (March/April) since spring 2000. Seven copepod assemblages were identiﬁed: four were found during the summer upwelling season, two during large El Nin˜ o events, and one during winter. Interannual variations in the composition of the summer assemblages was seen: most sampling dates from the summers of 1970, 1973, 2000 and 2001 clustered into one group, and dates from 1971, 1972, and 1999 clustered into a second group. The 1983 and 1998 El Nin˜ o events clustered together, but subdivided into ‘‘early El Nin˜ o’’ and ‘‘late El Nin˜ o’’ communities. The summer of 1969 corresponded with a weak El Nin˜ o event but clustered differently from both the other El Nin˜ o events and other summer clusters. Samples collected during the 1972 El Nin˜ o event clustered with ‘‘normal’’ summers. Non-metric multidimensional ordination analysis showed that two axes accounted for 87\% of the variability in community composition; Axis 1 was associated with the inﬂuence of El Nin˜ o events and seasonal downwelling, and Axis 2 was associated with upwelling-induced productivity. {ISA} showed Centropages abdominalis, Acartia longiremis, and Microcalanus pusillus as indicators of upwelling; Corycaeus anglicus, Calanus paciﬁcus, and Ctenocalanus vanus as good indicators of El Nin˜ o; and Ctenocalanus vanus, Clausocalanus, and Calocalanus styliremis as good indicators of winter conditions.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Hypoxia, triggered in large part by eutrophication, exerts widespread and expanding stress on coastal ecosystems. Hypoxia is often specifically defined as water having dissolved oxygen ({DO}) concentrations \&lt; 2 mg L$^{\textrm{−1}}$. However, {DO} concentration alone is insufficient to categorize hypoxic stress or predict impacts of hypoxia on zooplankton and fish. Hypoxic stress depends on the oxygen supply relative to metabolic demand. Water temperature controls both oxygen solubility and the metabolic demand of aquatic ectotherms. Accordingly, to assess impacts of hypoxia requires consideration of effects of temperature on both oxygen availability and animal metabolism. Temperature differences across ecosystems or across seasons or years within an ecosystem can dramatically impact the severity of hypoxia even at similar {DO} concentrations. Living under sub-optimum {DO} can reduce temperature-dependent metabolic efficiencies, prey capture efficiency, growth and reproductive potential, thus impacting production and individual zooplankton and fish fitness. Avoidance of hypoxic bottom water can reduce or eliminate low-temperature thermal refuges for organisms and increase energy demands and respiration rates, and potentially reduce overall fitness if alternative habitats are sub-optimal. Moreover, differential habitat shifts among species can shift predator-prey abundance ratios or interactions and thus modify food webs. For example, more tolerant zooplankton prey may use hypoxic waters as a refuge from fish predation. In contrast, zooplankton avoidance of hypoxic bottom waters can result in prey aggregations at oxyclines sought out by fish predators. Hypoxic conditions that affect spatial ecology can drive taxonomic and size shifts in the zooplankton community, affecting foraging, consumption and growth of fish. Advances in understanding the ecological effects of low {DO} waters on pelagic zooplankton and fish and comparisons among ecosystems will require development of generic models that estimate the oxygen demand of organisms in relation to oxygen supply which depends on both {DO} and temperature. We provide preliminary analysis of a metric (Oxygen Stress Level) which integrates oxygen demand in relation to oxygen availability for a coastal copepod and compare the prediction of oxygen stress to actual copepod distributions in areas with hypoxic bottom waters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Behavioral responses that enhance survival of stressed individuals may be critical for local populations to persist. Although the types and intensities of stressors can vary over the geographic range of a species, little is known regarding geographical variation in adaptive behavioral responses to stressors, especially in marine and estuarine species subject to human impact. To explore varied behavior in response to low dissolved oxygen (a human perturbation), we examined two geographically distinct populations of the copepod, Acartia tonsa. Chesapeake Bay copepods, historically exposed to oxygen gradients, avoided hypoxic bottom waters. In contrast, Florida copepods not typically exposed to hypoxia did not avoid lethal oxygen concentrations. Our results suggest that local behavioral adaptations may result from consequences of anthropogenic perturbations and may limit the ability to apply biological data across regions. Geographical differences in behavioral responses of important prey species may also result in geographic variation in the severity of disruption of aquatic food webs.},

	abstract = {Copepods, which play major roles in marine food webs and biogeochemical cycling, frequently undergo diel vertical migration ({DVM}), swimming downwards during the day to avoid visual predation and upwards at night to feed. Natural water columns that are stratified with chemical stressors at depth, such as hypoxia and acidification, are increasing with climate change. Understanding behavioral responses of copepods to these stresses — in particular, whether copepods alter their natural migration — is important to anticipating impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. We conducted laboratory experiments using stratified water columns to measure the effects of bottom water hypoxia and {pH} on mortality, distribution, and swimming behaviors of the calanoid copepod Calanus pacificus. When exposed to hypoxic (0.65 mg O2 l−1) bottom waters, the height of C. pacificus from the bottom increased 20\% within hypoxic columns, and swimming speed decreased 46\% at the bottom of hypoxic columns and increased 12\% above hypoxic waters. When exposed to low {pH} (7.48) bottom waters, swimming speeds decreased by 8 and 9\% at the base of the tanks and above acidic waters, respectively. Additionally, we found a 118\% increase in ‘moribund’ (immobile on the bottom) copepods when exposed to hypoxic, but not acidic, bottom waters. Some swimming statistics differed between copepods collected from sites with versus without historical hypoxia and acidity. Observed responses suggest potential mechanisms underlying in situ changes in copepod population distributions when exposed to chemical stressors at depth. © The authors 2022.},

Copepods and pteropods exhibited strong but divergent responses in the same habitat; copepods had higher oxygen-reactive absorbance capacity, glutathione-S-transferase, and total glutathione content. The ratio between reduced to oxidised glutathione was higher in copepods than in pteropods, indicating lower oxidative stress in copepods. Pteropods showed higher activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation, indicating increased antioxidant defences and oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant defence system of the copepods has a greater capacity to respond to oxidative stress, while pteropods already face severe stress and show limited capacity to deal with further changes. The results suggest that copepods have higher adaptive potential, owing to their stronger vertical migration behaviour and efficient glutathione metabolism, whereas pteropods run the risk of oxidative stress and mortality under high {CO} 2 conditions.

Acclimation to a warmer temperature significantly decreased the heat stress response in both species. In A. tonsa, short-term acclimation to heat was not detected at the organismal level via metabolic rate.

	abstract = {The Arctic region is undergoing rapid and significant changes, characterized by high rates of acidification and warming. These transformations prompt critical questions about the resilience of marine communities in the face of environmental change. In the Arctic, marine zooplankton and in particular calanoid copepods play a vital role in the food web. Changes in environmental conditions could disrupt zooplankton communities, posing detrimental consequences for the entire ecosystem. Copepod early-life stages have been shown to be particularly sensitive to environmental stressors since they represent a bottleneck in the life cycle. Here, we investigated the responses of 4-day old Calanus hyperboreus nauplii when exposed to acidification ({pH} 7.5 and 8.1) and warming (0 and 3°C), both independently and in combination. Naupliar respiration rates increased when exposed to a combination of acidification and warming, but not when exposed to the stressors individually. Moreover, we found no discernible differences in lipid content and fatty acid ({FA}) composition of the nauplii across the different experimental treatments. Wax esters accounted for approximately 75\% of the lipid reserves, and high amounts of long chain fatty acids 20:1 and 22:1, crucial for the reproduction cycle in copepods, were also detected. Our results indicate a sensitivity of these nauplii to a combination of acidification and warming, but not to the individual stressors, aligning with a growing body of evidence from related studies. This study sheds light on the potential implications of global change for Arctic copepod populations by elucidating the responses of early-life stages to these environmental stressors.

Under laboratory conditions the 6 groups examined (2 polychaetes 1 oligochaete, 1 archiannelid, 1 mystacocarid and 1 harpacticoid copepod) show a high sensitivity to hydrogen sulfid and a bad tolerance to a low ambient oxygen (below 0.5 ml O2/l). Above this critical limit they are more tolerant and different groups are considered either stenoxybiontic or euroxybiontic. The Cartesian diver microrespirometer is used to determine the oxygen consumption of the interstitial groups. A technique for filling divers with different gas mixtures is described. A distinction between metabolic regulators and metabolic conformers can be made for some species, other have complex metabolic rates. The euroxybiontic regulators Stygocapitella subterranea and Marionina achaeta show highest tolerance to low oxygen tension; this adaptive character enables these species to live at a high level of the sandy beach which is known as an oxygen-deficient habitat. The complex metabolic types, Protodriloides symbioticus and Hesionides arenaria are well adapted to resist in poor oxygenated habitat, they tend nevertheless to be more adapted to live in a fully oxidized sand, i.e. in the lower part of the semi-stable beach. Finally, Derocheilocaris remanei and Paraleptastacus spinicauda are stenoxybionts and conformers in low ambient oxygen; they require a fully oxidized biotope; the “high energy beach” being the appropriate habitat},

	abstract = {We describe a model predicting the effects of low environmental oxygen on vital rates (egg production, somatic growth, and mortality) of the coastal planktonic copepod Acartia tonsa. Hypoxic conditions can result in respiration rate being directly limited by oxygen availability. We hypothesized that A. tonsa egg production, somatic growth, and ingestion rates would all respond in a similar manner to low oxygen conditions, as a result of oxygen dependent changes in respiration rate. Rate data for A. tonsa egg production, somatic growth, and ingestion under low environmental oxygen were compiled from the literature and from supplementary experiments. The response of these rates to oxygen was compared by converting all to the analogous units in terms of oxygen utilization, which we termed analogous respiration rate. These analogous respiration rates, along with published measurements of respiration rates, were used to parameterize and evaluate the relationship between A. tonsa respiration rate and environmental oxygen. At 18°C, our results suggest that A. tonsa experiences sub-lethal effects of hypoxia below an oxygen partial pressure of 8.1 {kPa} (∼3.1 mg L−1 = 2.3 {mL} L−1). The results of this study can be used to predict the effects of hypoxia on A. tonsa growth and mortality as related to environmental temperature and oxygen partial pressure. Such predictions will be useful as a way to incorporate the effects of coastal hypoxia into population, community, or ecosystem level models that include A. tonsa. This approach can also be used to characterize the effects of hypoxia on other aquatic organisms.},

Copepods, often millimeter-sized crustaceans, are some of the most numerous multicellular organisms on earth and are key organisms in most aquatic food webs. Some important free-living marine and estuarine species overwinter or oversummer by arrested embryogenesis in dormancy. The present contribution discusses the complex mechanisms behind embryonic dormancy by compiling knowledge from the 42 calanoid copepods from the superfamily Centropagoidea with well-described embryonic dormancy, which has been of scientific interest for decades. However, the determination of categories of copepod resting eggs-that is, diapause and quiescence, transitions between categories, the mechanisms controlling arrested development by the embryos, and how they interact with their surroundings-is not fully understood. Moreover, a clear link between the presence of the free-swimming population and their resting eggs in sediments is still not convincingly demonstrated. Here I evaluate the relative significance of potential cues driving the production of and the phase shift between egg categories. Understanding the initiation and termination of embryonic dormancy is of great importance for fundamental science-that is, population and food web ecology as well as climate science, aquaculture live feed, and ballast water research. Molecular techniques are developing rapidly, especially within health sciences, thus providing relevant tools applicable for plankton research. Here I suggest that applying molecular methods in addition to traditional physiological approaches in future research will lead to greater understanding of copepod embryonic dormancy, one of nature's wonders.},

Transects across the continental margin typically show a gradient in community composition from primarily nearshore to primarily oceanic, and this gradient is usually steepest near the continental shelf break. However, the transition is often neither monotonic nor complete. Barriers to exchange of water and organisms across this transition are leaky and variable in their location and effectiveness. In this paper, we review mechanisms and consequences of shelf–offshore exchange of zooplankton. Many of these processes vary in sign and intensity with latitude and also in time (wind events, seasonal cycle, and interannual). In general, surface-layer transport of zooplankton is more likely to be seaward in summer and in lower-latitude “upwelling” regions, more likely to be shoreward in winter and in higher-latitude “downwelling” regions. Because zooplankton life cycles and depth distributions are also strongly seasonal, there are important interactions that could potentially drive large match–mismatch variations in distribution and survivorship of both zooplankton and their predators.},

	abstract = {Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) is a schooling planktivorous fish consumed by numerous fish, seabirds, and marine mammals. This paper aimed to determine whether Pacific herring serves as a key forage fish (i.e. strongly supports predator populations) in the southeastern Gulf of Alaska. All analyses were conducted using mass- and energy-balanced ecosystem models constructed in Ecopath with Ecosim. Supportive Role to Fishery ({SURF}) index values were computed using predator diets and food web structure encoded in static ecosystem models. Ecosystem impacts of herring stock depletion and collapse were evaluated using quantitative criteria (thresholds) applied to dynamic ecosystem simulations. {SURF} index values from mass-balanced models lay below the threshold required to designate herring as a key forage fish. However, values from an energy-balanced model supported the key status of herring. Dynamic ecosystem simulations in mass- and energy-balanced models revealed strong negative effects of herring depletion on several predators. In most energy-balanced models, simulation results designated herring as a key forage fish despite indications of functional redundancy in the forage fish guild. Impacts of herring depletion on predators were stronger and more numerous in energy-balanced models, suggesting that the high energy content of herring enhances its importance to predators. Simulation results also demonstrated positive impacts of herring depletion on two zooplankton groups due to release from predation pressure. The status of Pacific herring as a key forage fish apparently depends on its energy content relative to other forage fish. Nevertheless, the results of this study support precautionary, ecosystem-based management of Pacific herring fisheries.},

	abstract = {We examined zooplankton collected across a latitudinal gradient in the southern Salish Sea for changes during the 2015–2016 Pacific marine heatwave ({MHW}). Zooplankton were collected biweekly in vertical net tows from three regions of Puget Sound and one in northern Washington waters near the Strait of Juan de Fuca, from 2014 to 2020. Water temperatures were cooler in the north and warmer in the south, with anomalously high temperatures occurring in 2015–2016 in all regions. Chlorophyll biomass showed no consistent relationship with temperature. All regions had anomalously high zooplankton biomass in 2015, which continued in the three Puget Sound regions through 2017, with the two central stations showing the most dramatic increases. Several large crustacean species and molluscs showed positive biomass anomalies during the {MHW}. Euphausiid furcilia showed differential response by species. Puget Sound resident copepod species showed primarily positive anomalies, while some boreal and subarctic copepod species were anomalously low during this period. Gelatinous zooplankton had somewhat higher biomass through the first few years of the study, but patterns showed no clear relationship with the {MHW}. Differing zooplankton patterns compared to those observed in the California Current, as well as prolonged effects on zooplankton biomass in Puget Sound, suggest that local forcing played a dominant role, likely differing from the mechanisms affecting zooplankton in the California Current. Primary postulated factors include increased growth and metabolism due to higher temperatures, nutrient-driven increases in primary production, and changes in species composition advected from the ocean. Further research is needed to determine the ramifications of the changes and how they may affect the food web in the future.},

	shorttitle = {A synthesis tree of the Copepoda},
	abstract = {The Copepoda is a clade of pancrustaceans containing 14,485 species that are extremely varied in their morphology and lifestyle. Not only do copepods dominate marine plankton and sediment communities and make up a sizeable component of the freshwater plankton, but over 6,000 species are symbiotically associated with every major phylum of marine metazoans, mostly as parasites. Unfortunately, our understanding of copepod evolutionary relationships is relatively limited in part because of their extremely divergent morphology, sparse taxon sampling in molecular phylogenetic analyses, a reliance on only a handful of molecular markers, and little taxonomic overlap between phylogenetic studies. Here, a synthesis tree method is used to integrate published phylogenies into a more comprehensive tree of copepods by leveraging phylogenetic and taxonomic data. A literature review in this study finds fewer than 500 species of copepods have been sampled in molecular phylogenetic studies. Using the Open Tree of Life platform, those taxa that have been sampled in previous phylogenetic studies are grafted together and combined with the underlying copepod taxonomic hierarchy from the Open Tree of Life Taxonomy to make a synthesis phylogeny of all copepod species. Taxon sampling with respect to molecular phylogenetic analyses is reviewed for all orders of copepods and shows only 3\% of copepod species have been sampled in phylogenetic studies. The resulting synthesis phylogeny reveals copepods have transitioned to a parasitic lifestyle on at least 14 occasions. We examine the underlying phylogenetic, taxonomic, and natural history data supporting these transitions to parasitism; review the species diversity of each parasitic clade; and identify key areas for further phylogenetic investigation.},

We analyzed past regional variability and future changes in the Metabolic Index (Φ), a species-specific measure of the environment’s capacity to meet temperature-dependent organismal oxygen demand. Across the traits of diverse animals, Φ exhibits strong seasonal to interdecadal variations throughout the {CCS}, implying that resident species already experience large fluctuations in available aerobic habitat. For a key {CCS} species, northern anchovy, the long-term biogeographic distribution and decadal fluctuations in abundance are both highly coherent with aerobic habitat volume. Ocean warming and oxygen loss by 2100 are projected to decrease Φ below critical levels in 30 to 50\% of anchovies’ present range, including complete loss of aerobic habitat—and thus likely extirpation—from the southern {CCS}. Aerobic habitat loss will vary widely across the traits of {CCS} taxa, disrupting ecological interactions throughout the region.},
