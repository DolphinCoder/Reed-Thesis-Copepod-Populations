# This is a function to graph species presence and absence data over an environmental variable. 
# Both should have dates in POSIXct.

# This needs to be customized per script
# Don't expect it to be adaptable to much else due to all the janky stuff I've added.
# Things that don't adapt well: EllaInterest is manually added stats, and 
# PlotBase comes from whatever the full set of environmental data is named
# HypoxiaDots will prooobably cause problems
